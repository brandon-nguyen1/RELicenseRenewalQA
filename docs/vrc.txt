The Real Estate Exists
Physical and legal aspects of real estate
For most situations, the term “property” means 
a physical or tangible thing. However, property 
can be more broadly defined, focusing on the 
rights which arise out of the object. Thus, property 
is referred to as a bundle of rights, which for the 
purposes of this material is real estate. 
Further, property is anything which may be owned. 
In turn, ownership is the right to possess the property 
owned and use it to the exclusion of others. [Calif. 
Civil Code §654]
The right to possess  and use property includes the rights to:  
• occupy;  
• sell or dispose;  
• encumber; or  
• lease.  
OCCUPANCYCONTROLDISPOSITIONENJOYMENTEXCLUSION
2         Video Renewal Course: Real Estate Made Reel™Property is divided by types into two primary categories:  
• real estate, also called real property  or realty; and  
• personal property, also called personalty. [CC §657]
Real estate is characterized as immovable, whereas personal property 
is movable. [CC §§659, 657]
Personal property  is defined, by way of exclusion, as all property which 
is not classified as real estate. [CC §§658, 663]
While the distinction between real estate and personal property seems 
apparent at first glance, the difference is not always so clear.  
Cutting up the real estate  
Real estate may be physically cut up by severance  of a part of the 
earth (i.e., removal of minerals). Title to real estate may also be cut up 
in terms of time, providing sequential ownership.  
For example, fee ownership may be conveyed to one person for life, 
and on their death, transferred by the fee owner to another. Time 
sharing is another example of the allocation of ownership by time, 
such as the exclusive right to occupy a space for only three weeks 
during the year.  
Title to real estate may also be fractionalized by concurrently vesting 
title in the name of co-owners, such as tenants-in-common, who each 
Personal Property
Real EstatePhysical and legal aspects of real estate          3hold an undivided (fractional) ownership interest in the real estate.  
Possession to real estate may be cut out of the fee ownership and 
conveyed for a period of time. For instance, the fee owner of real 
estate acting as a landlord conveys possession of the property to a 
tenant under a lease agreement for a fixed term, called a tenancy. 
When the tenancy expires or is terminated, possession of the property 
reverts to the landlord. The landlord retains fee title to the real estate 
at all times, subject to the lease.  
Possession may also be cut up by creating divided interests in a 
property, as opposed to undivided interests. For example, an owner 
may lease a portion of their property to a tenant. The tenant, in turn, 
may sublease a portion of their space to yet another person, known 
as a subtenant. 
Other non-possessory interests in real 
estate may be created, such as liens. 
Liens are interests in real estate which 
secure payment or performance of 
a debt or other monetary obligation, 
such as a:
• trust deed lien; or
• local property tax lien.
On nonpayment of a lien amount, the 
lienholder may force the sale of the 
real estate to pay off and satisfy the 
lien.  
Thus, an owner’s rights in a parcel of 
real estate extend beyond the mere 
physical aspects of the land, airspace and improvements located 
within the legally described boundaries of the property.

Real estate components 
The physical components of real estate include:  
• the land;  
• anything affixed to the land;  
• anything appurtenant (incidental rights in adjoining property) to 
the land; and  
• anything which cannot be removed from the land by law. [Calif 
Civil Code §658]
Real estate includes buildings, fences, trees, watercourses and 
easements within a parcel’s horizontal and vertical boundaries. 
Anything below the surface, such as water and minerals, or above 
the surface in the air space, such as crops and timber, is part of the 
real estate.
For example, the rental of a boat slip includes the water and the land 
below it, both of which comprise the total of the rented real estate. 
Thus, landlord/tenant law controls the rental of the slip. [Smith v. 
Municipal Court  (1988) 202 CA3d 685]
In the case of a condominium unit, the air space enclosed within 6         Video Renewal Course: Real Estate Made Reel™the walls is the real estate. The structure itself, land and air space 
outside the unit are the property of the association or all the owners 
of the separate parcels of air space within the condominium project, 
creating what is called a common interest development (CID) . [CC 
§4125]
1. The physical components of real estate include everything EXCEPT:  
a. the land.  
b. anything affixed to the land.  
c. anything which can be removed from the land.
2. In a condominium unit, the air space enclosed within the walls is 
considered:
a. common interest ownership. 
b. an appurtenant right. 
c. real estate. 
3. In the instance of the rental of a boat slip, the total of the rented 
real estate includes:
a. the water below the boat slip. 
b. the land below the boat slip.
c. both the water and the land below the boat slip.The Boundaries of Real Estate           7
The boundaries of real estate
A parcel of real estate is located by defining its legal description on 
the face of the earth. Using the property’s legal description, a surveyor 
locates and sets the corners and horizontal boundaries  of the parcel.  
The legal, horizontal boundary description of real estate is documented 
in numerous locations, such as: 
• deeds;
• public records of the county where the parcel is located;
• subdivision maps; and
• government surveys relating to the property.  
Real estate is three-dimensional and reaches perpendicular to 
the horizontal boundary. In addition to the surface area between 
boundaries, the classic definition of real estate consists of the soil below 
to the core of the earth as well as the air space above to infinity.
All permanent structures, crops and timber within this inverse pyramid 
are also a part of the parcel of real estate. The three-dimensional 
aspect of real estate has its source in the English common law. [Calif 
Civil Code §659]8         Video Renewal Course: Real Estate Made Reel™1.Using a property’s legal description, a surveyor locates and sets:
a.the property address and metes and bounds description of a
parcel.
b.the baseline and vertical boundaries or a parcel.

3.The three-dimensional aspect of real estate has its source in:a.
Spanish civil law.
b.French Napoleonic law.
c.English common lawLand          9
Land
The first component of real estate is  land. Land includes:  
• soil;  
• rocks;  
• other materials of the earth; and  
• the reasonable airspace above the earth. [Calif. Civil Code 
§659]
The soil and solid materials, such as ores and minerals, are considered 
land while they remain undisturbed as a part of the earth.  For example, 
unmined gold dormant in the earth is real estate.  
However, when the gold is mined, it becomes personal property  since 
it is no longer embedded in the earth. The gold has been converted 
from something immovable — part of the rock below the soil — to 
something movable.  
Minerals in the soil are severable from the earth. Also, fee ownership to 
the soil and minerals may be conveyed away from the ownership of 
the remainder of the land.  
When ownership of minerals in a parcel of land is transferred, the 10         Video Renewal Course: Real Estate Made Reel™transfer establishes two fee owners of the real estate located within 
the same legal description — an owner of the surface rights and an 
owner of the mineral rights  beneath the surface.
These parties are not co-owners of the real estate, but individual owners of separate vertically-located portions of the same real estate. Both fee owners are entitled to reasonable use and access to their ownership interest in the real estate.
 
 
For example, an owner sells and conveys the right to extract minerals to a buyer. On conveyance, there now exists:
•
a surface owner; and
•a mineral rights owner.
Later, 
the surface owner conveys the real estate to a developer. The 
developer subdivides the parcel of real estate and plans to construct homes on the lots.
 
 
The mineral rights owner objects to the construction, claiming the homes, if built, will interfere with their right to enter the property and remove their minerals.
 
 
Is the mineral rights owner entitled to enter the property to remove the minerals?
 
 
Yes! But only as necessary to use their mineral rights. The rights of the surface owner and the mineral rights owner are thus balanced to determine the precise surface location to be used to extract the minerals. [Callahan v. Martin  (1935) 3 C2d 110]  
The right to remove minerals from another’s real estate is called a profit a prendre.
 Land          11It’s what’s underneath that’s important
The usability of a piece of land is determined by many obvious 
factors, easily recognizable to the average homebuyer. For 
example, if a road runs through the middle of the property, 
this will cause the homeowner to deal with a whole new set 
of issues.
Less obvious, but just as important, zoning can also pose a 
problem, for example, if a property is zoned for residential 
use and the buyer wishes to build a commercial building.
But what’s not visible to the naked eye (or even the county’s 
office) is the land’s most important characteristic: the soil.
Beyond whether or not a site has the ability to grow crops, the 
soil’s characteristics determine whether a home can even 
be built in that spot. Further, just because a neighboring lot 
has a home does not mean the lot in question is also safe to 
build on.
Soil is identified by its:
• texture;
• grade;
• color;
• permeability; and
• density.
Soil types
Three types of soil exist:
• clay, which has a fine texture, is extremely dense and 
limits the land’s use;
• loam, which has a medium texture and has the fewest 
limitations for use; and12         Video Renewal Course: Real Estate Made Reel™• sand, which has a coarse texture, is very permeable 
and is most susceptible to erosion.
The soil in your backyard is a mixture of clay and sand, as 
well as a smaller amount of silt (rock sediment). If it is majority 
clay, then it is considered clayey, and if it’s mostly sand with 
a little bit of clay, it’s considered sandy. If it is a mostly even 
mixture, your soil is loamy.
A soil’s grade is measured by the size of its grain. For instance, 
gravel has a very high grade, while clay has a lower grade. 
The lower the grade, the less permeable and less susceptible 
to movement the ground is.
Light-colored soil is more susceptible to erosion and has 
fewer nutrients. Darker soil is more nutrient rich and has a 
smaller erosion factor.
How permeable the soil is also affects the building site. For 
instance, soil with high permeability — meaning water passes 
through the soil rapidly — causes difficulty for septic systems. 
On the other hand, septic systems cannot operate in soil with 
very slow permeability, such as clay, which can also cause 
problems for foundations.
Before beginning construction, the builder will ensure 
the soil is compact, or dense enough to establish a 
foundation. Compaction is completed by basically smashing 
down the soil, reducing the space between grains.
Finally, land with a shallow soil depth will make it hard to 
establish a foundation, landscaping and a septic system. 
Generally, the higher the depth — the distance from the 
topsoil to the bedrock or the water table — the easier it is to 
build the home and its required support systems.
All of this soil science matters not just for building, but for 
safety, as California is susceptible to earthquakes.Land          13Liquefaction zones
Liquefaction occurs when soft soil moves or collapses during 
an earthquake. The ground “liquefies” or behaves like s and 
at the beach, and the buildings on top lose all stability.
Areas susceptible to liquefaction — called liquefaction 
zones  — are found mostly in low-lying areas along the coast. 
In the Bay Area, the U.S. Geological Survey claims most of 
San Francisco’s residents live and work in a liquefaction zone .
Liquefaction can also occur on artificial landfill — common 
in urban areas — and other young deposits, such as those 
near streams and rivers. 
A liquefaction zone is a type of seismic hazard.  Thus, the 
presence of a liquefaction zone needs to be noted in 
the Natural Hazard Disclosure Statement, which is delivered 
by the seller or their agent to the buyer. The seller needs to 
disclose the presence of natural hazards, no matter the type 
of property. [CC §1103.1(b); see RPI Form 314]14         Video Renewal Course: Real Estate Made Reel™1.The first component of real estate is land. Land includes all of the
following EXCEPT:
a.soil and rocks.
b.reasonable airspace above the earth.
c.crops cultivated for harvest and sale.
2.Mined gold is:a.
part 
of the real estate since it was embedded in the earth. The
gold retains its status as real estate when it was immovable for
a longer period of time than it was movable.
b.personal property since it is no longer embedded in the earth.The 
gold has been converted from something immovable —
part of the rock below the soil — to something movable.
c.personal 
property since it can be sold with a bill of sale. The
mined gold is considered personal property due primarily tothe fact that it may be sold.

Oil and gas
Unlike solid minerals which are stationary, oil and gas are mobile. 
Oil and gas are referred to as being fugacious matter as they are 
transitory.
 
 
Oil and gas are perpetually percolating under the earth’s surface. Due to their fleeting nature, a real estate owner does not hold title to the physical oil and gas situated under the surface of their real estate.
  
At 
any given time, a real estate owner will have more or less oil or 
gas depending on the earth’s movements. The ownership interest in unremoved oil and gas is referred to as a corporeal hereditament.
 
 
In California, oil and gas are incapable of being owned until they are actually possessed. Once they have been removed, they become personal property. [ Callahan v. Martin  (1935) 3 C2d 110]
A fee owner has the exclusive right to drill for oil and gas on their premises, unless that right has been conveyed away to others.
Rather than owning the physical oil and gas, the fee owner has a 
right, called an incorporeal hereditament, to remove the oil or gas for their purposes. [ Gerhard v. Stephens (1968) 68 C2d 864]16         Video Renewal Course: Real Estate Made Reel™A land owner has the right to extract all the oil and gas brought up 
from their real estate even if it is taken from an underground pool extending into an adjoining owners’ real estate. [Alphonzo E. Bell Corporation v. Bell View Oil Syndicate  (1938) 24 CA2d 587]  
However, an owner may not slant drill onto another’s property to reclaim the oil or gas that has flowed from their property. [Alphonzo E. Bell Corporation, supra]
Does a tax deed conveying surface rights to a parcel of real estate also convey rights to the oil and gas beneath the parcel?
Facts: A landowner leases oil and gas rights under their 
property to an oil company. Later, the owner defaults on a tax bill on the surface rights to a parcel of their real estate. The county forecloses and sells the parcel to a buyer. The tax deed conveying the parcel to the buyer does not include oil or gas royalties. Drilling operations commence to access the underground oil and gas.
Claim:  The buyer seeks a percentage of royalties resulting 
from the drilling operation on the parcel, claiming they hold 
an interest in the oil and gas beneath the parcel since they own the land on which the drilling operation is to occur.
Counterclaim:  The landowner claims the buyer holds no 
interest in the oil and gas beneath the parcel since the tax 
deed conveying the land to the buyer only conveyed the surface rights to the parcel, not oil and gas rights.
Holding: A California appeals court holds the buyer has 
no interest in the oil and gas beneath the parcel since the tax deed conveying the land to the buyer only conveyed surface rights to the parcel, not oil and gas rights. [Leiper v. Gallegos (November 20, 2019)
 _CA6th_]Oil and gas    171. Oil and gas are referred to as being __________ since they are 
transitory.
a. a fungible asset
b. fascia matter
c. fugacious matter
2. In California, oil and gas are incapable of being owned until they

a. real estate. 
b. personal property.
c. a license to possess property of another.  
3. A landowner has the right to extract all the oil and gas brought up 
from their real estate: 
a. even if it is taken from an underground pool extending into an

b. even if owner slant drills onto another’s property to reclaim the 
oil or gas that has flowed from their property.
c. only when the oil and gas are stationary below the owner’s real 
estate and no percolating under the earth’s surface.18         Video Renewal Course: Real Estate Made Reel™
Airspace   
Land also includes the airspace above the surface of a property. 
Under traditional English common law, the right to airspace continued to infinity. However, modern technological advances have altered the legal view on airspace.
 
 
For example, an owner runs a farm near a military airport with heavy air traffic. The government expands the military base by extending the runway to accommodate larger (and louder) aircraft. The aircraft, on their approach to the airport, now fly directly over the farmer’s barn, scaring the animals and causing the farmer financial loss.
 
 
The farmer sues the government for trespass on their real estate since the airspace is being occupied by others — the military.
 
 
Can the owner keep the aircraft from flying into their real estate?
 
No! The common law doctrine regarding the ownership of airspace 
to 
the edge of the universe is obsolete. The owner only owns the airspace necessary to allow them a reasonable use of their real estate. The owner’s real estate extends only so far above the surface of the earth as can be reasonably occupied or used in connection with the land. [United States v. Causby (1946) 328 US 256]Airspace            19However, when the flight of airborne vehicles intrudes upon an 
owner’s use and enjoyment of their real estate below, the intrusive 
entry may constitute a taking of the real estate. The continued noise 
and disturbance of low-flying aircraft has effectively taken something 
from the owner — the quiet use and enjoyment of their property. Thus, 
the owner needs to be compensated for their loss. [Causby, supra]
Other blue sky to be sold  
The airspace portion of land has also been modernized with the 
concept of the condominium. An owner of a condominium unit 
legally owns the right to occupy the parcel of airspace they have 
acquired which is enclosed between the walls, ceilings and floors of 
the structure.
Included in these ownership rights are incidental rights of ingress and 
egress, called appurtenances . Also included is the exclusive right to 
use other portions of the real estate for storage and parking, plus an 
undivided fractional interest in the common areas, directly or through 
a homeowners’ association (HOA). [Calif. Civil Code §4125]  
Also, the installation of active solar collectors has led to the right of 
access to sunlight and air which passes through airspace above 
property owned by others. This right of access to the sun for a solar 
collector is considered an easement. [Calif. Public Resources Code 
§§25980 et seq.; CC §801.5(a)(1)]
20         Video Renewal Course: Real Estate Made Reel™Solar easements and shady neighbors
A relatively recent type of easement is the solar easement. 
Solar easements were established with the intent of 
encouraging the productive use of solar energy systems as 
a matter of public policy.  
A solar easement granted in a written instrument needs to 
state:  
• the measured angles by which sunlight has to pass;  
• the hours of the day during which the easement is 
effective;  
• the limitations on any object which impairs the passage 
of sunlight through the easement; and  
• the terms for terminating or revising the easement. [Calif. 
Civil Code §801.5; see RPI Form 322]
Solar easements are similar to easements of light, air or view 
since they restrict an adjacent property owner’s ability to 
maintain any improvements interfering with a neighbor’s 
solar energy system.  
Consider a recorded restrictive covenant which limits 
the height of improvements on parcels within a housing 
development. A property owner’s tree exceeds the height 
limitation and a neighbor successfully enforces the restrictive 
covenant requiring the owner to maintain the tree below 
the designated height.  
In this instance, when the neighbor installs a solar collector 
on their property, they receive an incidental benefit from the 
height restriction since it limits the height of improvements on 
other parcels which hinder the passage of sunlight to their 
solar collector. [ Ezer v. Fuchsloch (1979) 99 CA3d 849]

Water  
Water in its natural state is considered real estate since it is part of the 
material of the earth. While water is real estate, the right to use water 
is an appurtenant  (incidental) right to the ownership of real estate.
Three key rights in water need to be separately understood:
• the right to use water; 
• the right to take water by appropriation rights; and
• the right to take water by prescriptive rights.
The right to use water is called a riparian right. Riparian rights refer to 
the rights of a real estate owner to take surface water from a running 
water source contiguous to their land, such as a river or stream. [Calif. 
Water Code §101]
The right to take water may be acquired by appropriation. The 
appropriator of water diverts water from a river or watercourse to their 
real estate for reasonable use. [In re Water of Hallett Creek Stream 
System (1988) 44 C3d 448]
Also, an individual may obtain prescriptive rights in water by wrongfully 
appropriating nonsurplus water openly and adversely under a claim of Water         25right for an uninterrupted period of at least five years. [City of Barstow 
v. Mojave Water Agency (2000) 23 C4th 1224]
However, all water in the state of California belongs to the people 
based on a public trust doctrine . Riparian, appropriation and 
prescriptive rights are subject to the state’s interest in conserving and 
regulating water use. [Wat C §101]
Water is used, not owned  
Water belongs in one of two categories:  
• surface water, consisting of watercourses, lakes, springs, marshes, 
ponds, sloughs and any other water flowing over the surface of 
the earth caused by rain, snow, springs or seepage; or  
• ground water, consisting of percolating, subterranean bodies of 
water located in underground basins . [Restatement of the Law 
2d Torts §§841, 845, 846]  
Holders of rights to withdraw surface waters have riparian rights. 
Holders of rights to pump ground water have overlying rights .  
The legal rights to extract and use water are based on priorities and 
are classified as:  
• land owner’s rights consisting of both riparian and overlying rights;  
• appropriation rights to withdraw water under license from the 
state; and  
• prescriptive rights to withdraw water legally entitled to be used 
by others.  
Riparian rights refer to a land owner’s appurtenant property right to 
withdraw water from an adjacent river or lake for beneficial use on 
their riparian land.  
Overlying rights refer to a land owner’s right to the use of ground water 
below the surface of their land.
An overlying land owner has rights to an allotment of water which 
is measured by the ground water in the basin over which their 26         Video Renewal Course: Real Estate Made Reel™land is located. Overlying land owners have equal rights against 
other overlying land owners to a basin’s ground water percolating 
underneath their land, subject to their  reasonable use of the water.  
Overlying and riparian rights are legally analogous to one another, 
except for the limitations placed on overlying land owners to use 
ground water and riparian land owners to use surface water. [City of 
Barstow v. Mojave Water Agency (2000) 23 C4th 1224]
A land owner’s use of water in the exercise of their riparian or overlying 
water rights has priority over water rights held by appropriators licensed 
by the state.  
Riparian and overlying water rights are part of the ownership of land, 
and run with the title to the land when it is sold. Water rights are not 
personal property which may be assigned or used for the benefit of 
other property. 
Land entitled to water rights  
Riparian land is a parcel of real estate located both adjacent to a 
water source with surface water and within the watershed (basin) of 
the surface water.  
A parcel is considered riparian land when it:  
• touches the surface water; or  
• was part of a larger riparian parcel and retained its riparian rights 
by reassignment when parceled.  
The amount of frontage in actual contact with the surface water of 
a river or lake does not determine whether a parcel is considered 
riparian land. For example, a 40-acre tract of land, of which only 250 
feet abuts a stream, is considered riparian land. [Joeger v. Mt. Shasta 
Power Corp.  (1932) 214 C 630]  
To constitute riparian land, a property also needs to be located within 
the watershed surrounding the watercourse. Should a portion of 
riparian land extend outside the watershed, only the portion within 
the watershed is entitled to use the water from the watercourse.  Water         27Surface water used on land located within its watershed will eventually 
return to the watercourse, minus the water consumed, in a natural 
process called percolation. Additionally, rain falling on lands within the 
watershed of a watercourse feeds the watercourse. Thus, a riparian 
land owner may only divert water to the portion of their land which 
allows the water to return to the watercourse.
Land lying within the watershed of one stream above the point 
where the two streams unite, called a confluence, is not considered 
to be riparian to the other. Further, the surface flow (river) below the 
confluence of two streams is a new and entirely different watershed, 
justifying a new name for the river below the confluence, as is the 
practice in Mexico to distinguish the watershed. [Anaheim Union Water 
Co. v. Fuller  (1907) 150 C 327]
Riparian rights are appurtenant  
The right to use riparian water is an appurtenant (incidental) right 
attached to and transferred with the ownership of real estate. [Calif. 
Civil Code §§658, 662]
Each riparian land owner is entitled to a reasonable use of the natural 
flow of stream water running through or adjacent to their land. However, 
the quantity of the water withdrawn is subject to an upstream riparian 
land owner’s priority right  to first withdraw water for reasonable use on 
their upstream riparian land.  
Additionally, a riparian land owner may not divert stream water to 
nonriparian lands, even when they are entitled to use the water on 
their riparian land, since they are subject to the rules of percolation 
within the watershed. The land owner’s riparian right to use the surface 
water is appurtenant to the land bordering the stream, not other lands 
without a border on the stream. [ Gould v. Eaton (1897) 117 C 539] 
Reasonable use and domestic priorities    
Riparian rights are limited by the requirement that water taken from a 
stream needs to be put to a reasonable and beneficial use. Water is a 
state resource which, when used under a legal right, needs to be put 28         Video Renewal Course: Real Estate Made Reel™to reasonable and beneficial use to the fullest extent possible. No one 
has a protectable interest in the unreasonable use of water. [Calif. 
Constitution, Article X §2]
Reasonable and beneficial uses include:
• domestic uses; and
• agricultural irrigation.
Whether a particular use of water is reasonable and beneficial is 
determined on a case by case basis. [Calif. Constitution, Article X §2]
While riparian land owners hold the same classification of legal rights 
to water, they need to share the water, giving priority to domestic uses 
over other uses, including agricultural irrigation.  
The sharing of water between riparian land owners, with priority 
to upstream owners, is based on a tiered variety of priority and 
subordinate uses across the entire group of riparian owners, called 
correlative rights. Each land owner holds correlative rights within the 
riparian class of water rights.  
Water rights are usufructuary  
Owners of land and water providers (appropriators) who 
hold water rights do not legally own water. They own rights to 
the reasonable use of the water. Their right-to-use is subject 
to change when circumstances controlling the use of water 
change, called usufructuary rights . It is a sort of “here today, 
gone tomorrow” approach to access and possession.  
When a riparian land owner is not using water, downstream 
riparian land owners are entitled to the full flow of the water, 
subject to the upstream riparian owner’s future reasonable 
use. Thus, the lack of use of the appurtenant right to water is 
not lost by mere nonuse alone.  Water         29However, an upstream riparian owner who is not using their 
allotment of water may not divert water to nonriparian land 
since the water does not percolate into the watershed. 
[Gould, supra]
Competing water rights and allotments
In 1943, California established the State Water Resources 
Control Board (Board). The Board acts as a referee for all 
disputes over water rights. The Board advises the California 
courts on the appropriate water allotment each of the 
disputing parties is entitled to take. Also, on a request from 
holders of water rights, the Board itself may hear legitimate 
disputes between the parties to determine the water 
allotment each party is entitled to take. [Calif. Water Code 
§2501]
When the Board determines the allotment of water to each 
holder of riparian rights, the needs of all riparian land owners 
within the watershed are taken into account. The amount of 
water allocated to a riparian owner is individually determined 
based on numerous factors, such as the need for domestic 
use, irrigation and generating power.  
For example, an upstream owner of 66 acres of riparian 
land suitable for profitable irrigation is entitled to a smaller 
proportion of the water from a watercourse running through 
their land than a downstream owner of 96 acres of riparian 
land also suitable for profitable irrigation. [Half Moon Bay 
Land Co. v. Cowell  (1916) 173 C 543]
Riparian rights not lost by disuse  
An owner of riparian land has water rights which are “part 
and parcel” of their land, called appurtenant rights. As 
appurtenant rights, riparian water rights cannot be lost by 
disuse.  30         Video Renewal Course: Real Estate Made Reel™For example, co-owners of riparian land partition the land, 
providing each with separate ownership of a pro rata portion. 
The partition is made by deeds which grant each owner their 
pro rata share of the original parcel’s riparian right to the 
stream flow running through the parcels. Concurrently, the 
co-owner receiving the southern parcel is given an easement 
across the northern parcel to construct a pipeline to divert 
their share of the water from the stream to their parcel.  
The southern owner never builds the pipeline and never 
diverts the water. Later, the northern owner begins to divert 
all the water from the stream to their parcel above the point 
where the pipeline easement meets the stream.  
The southern owner claims the northern owner may not divert 
all the water from the stream since, as a riparian owner, 
the southern owner is entitled to their pro rata share of the 
stream’s flow, whether or not they use their share.  
The northern owner claims they may divert all of the stream 
water since the rights of the southern owner to divert the 
water were contingent on the construction of the pipeline 
and the diversion of the water, which was never done.  
However, the northern owner may not interfere with the 
southern owner’s riparian right to their reasonable share of 
the stream’s flow. The riparian rights of the southern owner 
are “part and parcel” of their land, appurtenant rights which 
cannot be lost by disuse alone. The pipeline easement also 
cannot be lost by disuse alone. [Parker v. Swett (1922) 188 C 
474]
Consider two appropriators who have no riparian rights 
appurtenant to any land but are allowed to withdraw 
water up to a set amount in the river. Additionally, both 
appropriators are entitled to take water unused by senior 
appropriators.  Water         31The senior appropriator fails to take their entitled amount 
of unused water during a five-year period. The junior 
appropriator seeks to reduce the amount of the senior 
appropriator’s entitlement to the amount actually used 
each month during the prior five years, claiming the senior 
appropriator’s nonuse forfeited the unused portion of their 
entitlement.  
The senior appropriator claims they did not forfeit their right 
by nonuse since the amount of unused water available 
is unpredictable and therefore cannot be forfeited. Did 
the senior appropriator forfeit the unused portion of their 
entitlement to unused water?  
Yes! The senior appropriator’s nonuse forfeited their right to 
take unused water, entitling the junior appropriator to take 
the unused water up to the amount of their entitlement. 
[North Kern Water Storage District  v. Ken Delta Water District 
(2007) 147CA4th 555]
Public dedication by allowing use  
For example, a downstream riparian owner constructs a 
canal to divert a large portion of a river’s flow. The water is 
diverted for the domestic and irrigation uses of towns which 
were established and grew in reliance on the diverted 
water. The extent of the diversion is known to an upstream 
owner who allows the diversion to continue uninterrupted for 
several years.  
Later, the upstream owner begins to take water from the river 
for irrigation of their lands, diminishing the amount of water 
available for the public use. The downstream owner seeks to 
bar the upstream owner from diverting the water, claiming 
the diversion upstream now deprives the downstream riparian 
owner of the water they were accustomed to diverting for 
the public use.  32         Video Renewal Course: Real Estate Made Reel™The upstream riparian owner claims they are entitled to 
divert the water for irrigation of their riparian lands since, as 
a riparian owner, they are entitled to use a reasonable share 
of the river water.  
The downstream riparian owner claims the upstream riparian 
owner is not entitled to divert water for irrigation since the 
water taken by the downstream owner is devoted to public 
use in reliance on the upstream owner’s disuse.  
In this instance, the upstream riparian owner may not 
now interfere with the downstream diversion of water. The 
diversion of water for public use was allowed to continue 
unchecked for a period of years. This non-interference 
conduct constituted a dedication of the upstream owner’s 
water rights to public use. The upstream riparian owner’s only 
recourse is to seek compensation for their lost riparian rights 
from the downstream owner. [Miller & Lux v. Enterprise Canal 
& Land Co. (1915) 169 C 415]
Termination of riparian rights   
Consider riparian land fronting a river or lake which is 
parceled. One of the parcels created has no frontage on 
the watercourse. The parcel is later conveyed without a 
provision in the deed transferring the riparian rights.  Here, 
the parcel conveyed without reference to its riparian rights 
loses its riparian land status forever. 
The conveyance of a parcel, severed from a larger parcel 
which has riparian rights, terminates the conveyed parcel’s 
riparian rights unless the rights are transferred by the deed 
which severed the parcel. Even when the severed parcel is 
eventually conveyed to waterfront owners of portions of the 
original riparian tract, the severed parcel’s status remains 
nonriparian. [Anaheim Union Water Co., supra]Water         33Appropriation by nonriparian owners    
The right to the use of water located within the state of 
California may be acquired by appropriation by applying 
for a permit from the Board. [Wat C §102]
On the approval of an application for an appropriation permit 
by the Board, the permit is issued granting the appropriator 
the right to use water only to the extent and for the purpose 
described in the permit, called appropriation rights. [Wat C 
§1381]
Waters flowing underground or surface waters flowing in 
natural channels in excess of the entitlement of riparian, 
overlying and previously appropriated water rights are 
considered the public water of the State of California. These 
excess waters are subject to appropriation by anyone. [Wat 
C §1201]
Rights of appropriator against others  
An appropriator’s rights against other appropriators are 
based on the “first in time, first in right” theory. Thus, prior 
appropriators may divert all the water allotted for use under 
their permit before later appropriators may divert water, a 
tiered condition called priority. [CC §1414]
The excess water previously allotted to later (junior) 
appropriators may not now exist after prior (senior) 
appropriators take their allotment, leaving no water to be 
taken by junior appropriators. Correlative rights to a parity 
share do not exist among appropriators since they are not 
riparian or overlying land owners.  
Additionally, land owners possessing riparian and overlying 
rights have water rights which are superior to the rights of 
appropriators, called priority rights. Appropriators may only 34         Video Renewal Course: Real Estate Made Reel™appropriate water which is not presently being used by a 
riparian or overlying land owner and has not already been 
appropriated by anyone else, called surplus water.  
In the event of a water shortage, appropriators have to yield 
to riparian and overlying land owners since land owners 
have priority rights to divert or pump water. These rights are 
appurtenant to their property. [City of Barstow, supra]
When a person licensed to appropriate water fails to use 
the water for a period of five years, their appropriation rights 
terminate and the water allocated to the appropriator 
reverts back to the public. Once the water reverts to the 
public, it is once again regarded as unappropriated. [Wat 
C §1241]
Prescriptive rights by converting water  
Prescriptive rights  to the use of water may be established 
when a person appropriates nonsurplus water openly and 
adversely for an uninterrupted period of five years, and 
does so without documentation or evidence of a legal 
right, called a claim of right. Essentially, an adverse user is 
converting water, which riparian or overlying land owners 
have the right to withdraw, to their use without a good faith 
belief they hold any legal rights to its use. 
Riparian and overlying owners may interrupt anyone trying 
to obtain prescriptive rights by continuing to use their 
allotment of water. Holders of riparian and overlying rights 
lose priority to those who obtain prescriptive rights to water, 
since their water rights have been lost to the extent taken by 
prescription. [City of Barstow, supra]
For example, an upstream riparian owner builds a dam which 
stops the flow of a stream to a downstream riparian owner. 
The downstream riparian owner is aware of the dam and Water         35allows the upstream owner to divert the flow of the stream 
for over five years.  
Later, the downstream riparian owner seeks to stop the 
upstream riparian owner from diverting the flow of the stream, 
claiming they are entitled to a portion of the stream’s flow 
since they are a riparian owner.  
The upstream riparian owner claims the downstream riparian 
owner may not stop the upstream riparian owner from 
diverting the stream since the upstream riparian owner have 
been openly and adversely diverting the water for over five 
years and now hold prescriptive rights in the water which 
may not be taken from them.  
In this situation, the downstream riparian owner may not 
stop the upstream riparian owner from diverting the stream. 
The upstream riparian owner has been adversely diverting 
the water with the downstream riparian owner’s knowledge 
for over five years. Thus, the upstream riparian owner now 
has prescriptive rights in the water which are superior to the 
riparian rights of the downstream riparian owner. [Sibbett v. 
Babcock  (1954) 124 CA2d 567]
Prescriptive rights, like appropriation rights, may also be lost 
by abandonment after five years. [CC §811]
Regulation of water rights by the Board  
Riparian, overlying and appropriation rights are subject to 
the state’s interest in conserving and regulating water use. 
The state government, under its Board, controls unclaimed 
water rights and partitions water for the highest and most 
beneficial use. [Wat C §101]
The state government regulates the use of water in California 
when disputes arise between riparian/overlying land owners 
and appropriators. The Board determines the respective 36         Video Renewal Course: Real Estate Made Reel™water rights of individuals and makes decisions by weighing 
the public interest versus the needs of individuals. [Wat C 
§2501]
Consider a city whose water supply is experiencing a shortage 
since the underground water basin is being overdrawn. A 
resolution is adopted by the city calling for those land owners 
and appropriators who agree to be bound by the solution 
to give up their water rights in exchange for an allotment 
of water. Each user agreeing to the allotment is given an 
amount they may pump without charge. The amount of the 
allotment is based on the highest quantity of water the user 
consumed annually during the last five years. A fee will be 
charged to pay for the purchase and replacement of water 
used beyond the allotted amount.  
Additionally, the terms of the resolution are imposed on all 
land owners with overlying water rights even if they do not 
agree to the resolution, thus eliminating their priority water 
rights.  
An overlying land owner subjected to the resolution claims 
a taking of their priority water rights has occurred without 
compensation since the city’s allocation solution elevates 
the rights of appropriators and those without any water rights 
to the status of riparian owners.  
The city claims placing the owner under the city’s water 
resolution is not a taking since the state Constitution requires 
the water supply to be made available to the largest number 
of users the water supply can reasonably support.  
However, placing the overlying land owner under the city’s 
water resolution does constitute a taking. The city may 
impose a water resolution to achieve a practical allocation 
of water among those with competing interests in the water. 
However, the city’s resolution may not ignore priority rights Water         37of overlying land owners who assert them, change priorities 
among the class of holders of water rights nor eliminate vested 
water rights. Thus, the overlying land owners have priority 
over appropriators to the ground water and may pump to 
satisfy their domestic and agricultural irrigation needs which 
are reasonable and beneficial. [City of Barstow, supra]38         Video Renewal Course: Real Estate Made Reel™1. __________ refer to the rights of a real estate owner to take surface

Affixed to the land  
Real estate includes things which are affixed to the land. Things may 
be affixed to the land by:  
• roots (e.g., shrubs and trees);  
• embedment (e.g., walls);  
• permanently resting (e.g., structures); or  
• physically attached (e.g., by cement or nails). [Calif. Civil Code 
§660]
Things attached to the earth naturally are real estate. Natural fixtures 
to the land, called fructus naturales , include:
• trees;
• shrubs; and
• grass.  
However, natural items planted and cultivated for human consumption 
and use are fruits of labor, called fructus industriales .  
Fructus industriales include such things as crops and standing timber. 
Crops and timber are ordinarily considered real estate. However, 
industrial crops and standing timber sold under a purchase agreement 40         Video Renewal Course: Real Estate Made Reel™and scheduled to be removed are considered personal property. 
[Calif. Commercial Code §9102(a)(44)]
1. Trees, shrubs, grass and other natural fixtures to the land are 
examples of: 
a. fructus naturales.
b. fructus industrials.
c. emblements. 
2. Natural items planted and cultivated for human consumption and 
use are called: 
a. fructus naturales.
b. fructus industrials.
c. iumentis.
3. Industrial crops and standing timber sold under a purchase 
agreement and scheduled to be removed are considered:
a. real estate.
b. personal property. 
c. fructus naturales.Fixtures            41
Fixtures  
A fixture is personal property which has become  permanently attached 
to real estate. As it is permanently attached, it effectively becomes 
part of the real estate and is conveyed with it. [Calif. Civil Code §660]
Factors which determine whether an item is a fixture 
or removable improvement include:  
• relationship of the parties;  
• agreement between the parties;  
• intention of the parties;  
• manner of attachment; and  
• adaptability of attachment to the real estate’s 
use. [San Diego Trust & Savings Bank v. San Diego County (1940) 
16 C2d 142]
Individuals most likely to dispute whether an item is a fixture include:  
• buyers and sellers;  
• landlords and tenants;  
• a builder and an owner;  42         Video Renewal Course: Real Estate Made Reel™• a lender and an owner; and  
• the county assessor and an owner.  
The most important factor when determining whether an item is a 
fixture or improvement is the intent of the parties .  
Intent to make an item a permanent part of the real estate as a fixture 
is determined by:  
• the manner of attachment; and  
• the use and purpose of the item in dispute.  
For example, when an item is attached to real estate by bolts, screws, 
cement or the like, the item is a fixture and part of the real estate. An 
item need not be attached to the real estate in this manner to be a 
fixture. Items of such weight and size that gravity maintains them in 
place are sufficient to give the item the character of permanence 
and affixation to be real estate.  
Also, the item may be constructively attached when the item is a 
necessary, integral or working part of improvements on the real estate.  Fixtures            431. A fixture is personal property which has become permanently 
attached to real estate. Which of the following statements is most 
correct?
a. Nothing is inextricable attached, and thus a fixture always 
remains separate from the underlying real estate. 
b. As it is permanently attached, it becomes part of the real estate 
and is conveyed separately using a bill of sale. 
c. As it is permanently attached, it effectively becomes part of 
the real estate and is conveyed with it.
2. Intent to make an item a permanent part of the real estate as a 
fixture is determined by:  
a. the manner of attachment; and  
b. the use and purpose of the item in dispute.  
c. Both a. and b.
3. When an item is attached to real estate by bolts, screws or cement, 
the item is generally:
a. a fixture and part of the real estate.
b. a trade fixture and subject to removal. 
c. a permissive improvement which may or may not need to be 
removed. 44         Video Renewal Course: Real Estate Made Reel™
Trade fixtures   
Fixtures which are used to render services or make products for the 
trade or business of a tenant are called trade fixtures .  
Trade fixtures are 
removed by the tenant 
on termination of 
the tenancy, unless 
agreed to the contrary 
with the landlord. 
The removal may not 
unduly damage the 
real estate. [Calif. Civil 
Code §1019]
Thus, trade fixtures are considered personal property .  
To be considered a trade fixture, a fixture needs to be an essential 
part of the tenant’s business and its removal may not substantially 
damage the real estate. 
Trade fixtures            45In the instance of a beauty salon, trade fixtures include:
• mirrors;
• sink bowls;
• dryers; and
• installed wash stations. [Beebe  v. Richards (1953) 115 CA2d 589]46         Video Renewal Course: Real Estate Made Reel™1. Fixtures which are used to render services or make products for the 
trade or business of a tenant are:
a. capital expenditures. 
b. trade fixtures.
c. Appurtenant rights. 
2. On the termination of a tenancy, trade fixtures are generally:
a. removed by the tenant when their removal does not unduly 
damage the real estate.
b. removed by the landlord when their removal poses the risk of 
damage to the real estate.
c. retained at the property and become the property of the 
landlord through reversion. 
3. Trade fixtures are considered:
a. real estate since they are not an essential part of the tenant’s 
business. 
b. personal property since they are an essential part of the tenant’s 
business. 
c. either real estate or personal property depending on the 
manner of attachment. Appurtenant rights             47
Appurtenant rights 
Real estate also includes any incidental rights which are not located 
on the real estate nor reflected on its title, called appurtenant rights. 
Appurtenant rights include the right of ingress and egress (entry and 
exit) across adjoining properties. [Calif. Civil Code §662]
An appurtenant easement is an interest held by an owner of one 
parcel of real estate to use adjoining real estate.
Under an appurtenant easement, an owner’s right to use adjoining 
real estate is part of their real estate, although it is not reflected on 
the title to the real estate. This right to use adjoining property runs with 
the land and is automatically conveyed with the real estate when 
the owner sells it. Appurtenant rights remain with the real estate they 
benefit and do not transfer from person to person.   
Other appurtenant rights to real estate include the right to the lateral 
and subjacent support  provided by the existence of adjoining real 
estate. For example, the owner of real estate may not remove soil 
from their land if doing so causes the adjoining real estate to subside 
or collapse.  48         Video Renewal Course: Real Estate Made Reel™Appurtenant rights held by an owner of one property are a recorded 
encumbrance on title to the adjacent property burdened by the 
appurtenant rights, such as an easement.
1. Incidental rights in a property which are not located on the real 
estate nor reflected on its title are:
a. inalienable rights. 
b. assignable rights. 
c. appurtenant rights.
2. Which of the following statements about appurtenant is most 
correct? 
a. Appurtenant rights can include the right to license a specific 
portion of an adjacent property for a specified use.
b. Appurtenant rights can include the right of ingress and egress 
across adjoining properties.
c. Appurtenant rights can include the right to take private property 
for public use. 
3. An owner of real estate may not remove soil from their land:
a. if doing so causes the adjoining real estate to subside or 
collapse.  
b. unless they obtain the written approval of the neighboring 
property owner. 
c. without restriction since it is their real estate.  Basics of California Real Estate Law             49
Basics of California Real Estate Law
The English and Spanish influence 
Historically, California real estate law has been influenced by two key 
sources of human conduct:  
• the English legal system, or common law; and  
• the Spanish legal system, or civil law .  
The common law of England has been the predominant influence on 
California real estate law. This legal framework was officially adopted 
by California soon after obtaining statehood in 1850. [Calif. Civil Code 
§22.2]
Under the common law, legal disputes are decided on a case-by-
case basis before a judge. Even today, the common law is often 
called “judge-made” law. When similar legal disputes arise, the judges 
refer back to the logic of earlier decisions to decide current cases. The 
reliance on an earlier decision to decide a current case is called stare 
decisis. The earlier case relied on is called precedent . 
Similarly, the civil law of Spain had a significant impact on California 
real estate law. Civil law establishes statutes to settle legal disputes 50         Video Renewal Course: Real Estate Made Reel™in advance, rather than on a 
case-by-case basis. 
These legal traditions continue 
to exist today in the form of:
• statutes, regulations and 
ordinances; and
• case law. 
The role of the U.S. 
Constitution  
The United States Constitution (U.S. Constitution) is the supreme law of 
the United States. [United States Constitution, Article VI, clause 2]
All powers which the state and federal governments possess are 
derived from the U.S. Constitution.  
The U.S. Constitution lists and explains the powers of the federal 
government. All other powers not given to the federal government 
rest with the individual states or with the people. [U.S. Const., Amend. 
X]
The form of government in which individual states share powers with a 
national or central government is called federalism.  
Under federalism, the individual states remain independent (sovereign) 
to regulate any matters within their own borders which are not already 
controlled by the federal government.  
Each state has its own constitution to regulate state matters remaining 
under their control. A state may provide more constitutional protection 
than the federal government if it chooses, but it may not provide less.  
Separated powers  
Both the federal and state governments created under the U.S. 
Constitution are separated into three branches:  
• the legislative  [U.S. Const., Art. I];
The English and Spanish influence           51• the executive [U.S. Const., Art. II]; and  
• the judicial. [U.S. Const., Art. III]
The state and federal legislatures enact the codes and statutes which 
regulate most aspects of real estate interests.  
The executive polices the law and establishes regulations to carry out 
the administration of government as established by the legislature.  
The judiciary settles disputes and issues case opinions regarding the 
application of the law and regulations.  
No branch may exercise a power given to another branch.52         Video Renewal Course: Real Estate Made Reel™1. The common law of England has been the predominant influence 
on California real estate law. Under the common law, legal disputes:
a. are settled in advance through a series of statutes, regulations 
and ordinances.
b. are decided on a case-by-case basis before a judge.
c. are adjudicated by the third-party mediator who will guide the 
contesting parties to reach a meeting of the minds.  
2. Under English common law, when similar legal disputes arise, the 
judge refers back to the logic of earlier decisions to decide current 
cases. The earlier case relied on is called: 
a. law.
b. precedent.
c. precursor. 
3. __________ establishes statutes to settle legal disputes in advance, 
rather than on an individual case-by-case basis. 
a. Spanish civil law
b. Scandinavian civil law
c. Portuguese civil lawAmerican Rule           53
American Rule
The Mexican-American War ended with the signing of the Treaty of 
Guadalupe Hidalgo. Under the treaty, the United States agreed to 
acknowledge the existing land grants conveyed by the Spanish and 
Mexican governments.  
The United States set up a land commission to document the validity 
of the land grants. 
The land commission established land titles and created 
the chain of title still used for all California real estate today.  
After confirmation of a valid land grant, the land was 
surveyed by the federal government and conveyed to 
the rightful owner by a United States patent deed.  
All land not under a valid claim became part of the 
public domain of the United States.  
In 1850, the United States granted part of 
the unclaimed real estate to the State of 
California. The balance was retained by 
the federal government.  
54         Video Renewal Course: Real Estate Made Reel™The federal and state legislatures as well as local governments enact 
laws they have been authorized to by the United States Constitution  or 
the California Constitution .

Authority to legislate
The authority of the California legislature to enact laws regulating real 
estate activities comes from four main constitutional powers:  
• police power;  
• power of eminent domain; 
• power to tax; and 
• escheat, the reverting of property to the state when the owner 
dies and there are no capable heirs to inherit it. 
These four powers can be memorized using the mnemonic device 
PETE. 
The U.S. Constitution confers on California the right to enact laws to 
protect public health, safety and welfare. [U.S. Const., Amend. X]
The California Constitution confers an equal power to local cities and 
counties to likewise protect the public good. [California Constitution, 
Article XI §7]
This power to protect the public well-being is called police power. 
Police power is the source of the state or local government’s authority 
to act.   56         Video Renewal Course: Real Estate Made Reel™Police power is the basis for laws governing such things as highway 
construction and maintenance, rent control, zoning and traffic. 
[Village of Euclid, Ohio v. Ambler Realty Co. (1926) 272 US 365]
A statute or ordinance passed under the government’s constitutional 
police power and affecting real estate-related activity is valid as long 
as the law:  
• is fair and reasonable;  
• addresses a legitimate state interest;  
• does not unreasonably burden the flow of interstate commerce; 
and  
• does not conflict with related federal law. Authority to Legislate          571. The authority of the California legislature to enact laws regulating 
real estate activities comes from four main constitutional powers – 
police power, power of eminent domain, power to tax and: 
a. escheat.
b. zoning. 
c. ccode enforcement. 
2. The constitutional power which is the source of the state or local 
government’s authority to act to protect the public well-being is 
called:
a. police power.
b. power of eminent domain.
c. power to tax.
3. Police power is the basis for laws governing all of the following 
EXCEPT:
a. rent control, zoning and traffic.
b. local inspection fees placed on landlords renting residential 
properties.
c. highway construction and maintenance.58         Video Renewal Course: Real Estate Made Reel™
Eminent domain  
The second key power of the state to regulate real estate is the power 
of eminent domain. [Calif. Constitution, Art. 1 §19]
Eminent domain is the right of the government to take private property 
for public use.  The process of using the power of eminent domain is 
called condemnation .  
However, the government needs to pay the owner the fair market 
value of the property taken. [Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan CATV 
Corp. (1982) 458 US 419]
Examples of eminent domain include condemning property to provide 
highways and roads, establish parks, construct flood control levees 
and provide land for redevelopment.  Eminent Domain, the Power to Tax and Escheat           59Inverse condemnation  
The government’s exercise of police power 
may become a taking of an owner’s real 
estate by inverse condemnation if the 
government surpasses their power 
of eminent domain.  
For example, an owner demolishes 
their beachfront bungalow. The 
owner intends to rebuild a better 
home and submits an application 
to the coastal commission which 
has jurisdiction over the use of 
beachfront property.  
A public beach is located nearby, but not directly adjacent 
to the owner’s real estate.  
The coastal commission grants the owner a permit to build, 
conditioned on the owner granting to the public a frontage 
easement across their beachfront property. The coastal 
commission claims its goal is to allow better public viewing 
of the coastline.  
The owner refuses to comply with the condition unless the 
coastal commission pays for the easement. The coastal 
commission denies the owner’s application and permit to 
build, claiming it is reasonably exercising its police power.  
Does the coastal commission have to pay for the easement 
across the owner’s beachfront?  
Yes! The coastal commission has not merely restricted the 
owner’s use of their land, it has required the owner to deed 
an interest away in the form of a frontage easement. [Nollan 
v. California Coastal Commission  (1987) 483 US 825]
60         Video Renewal Course: Real Estate Made Reel™ The power to tax  
State and local governments also regulate the crucial power to tax 
real estate activities to generate revenue and fund state and local 
governmental functions under their police power. [Calif. Const., Art. 
XIII D §6]
For example, a city passes an ordinance which imposes an inspection 
fee on all landlords renting residential properties. The fee charged is 
based on a flat rate per unit, not on current property values.  
A landlord subject to the ordinance claims the ordinance is 
unenforceable since the city must have voter approval before 
adopting an ordinance which imposes a regulatory fee on property.  
The city claims the ordinance is enforceable without voter approval 
since the fee is imposed on a use of the property — renting — not on 
the mere ownership of the property, which requires voter approval.  Conditioning a permit to build on the granting of an easement 
to the public is a taking which requires reimbursement to 
the owner from the governmental agency. The coastal 
commission did not show the easement related to a legitimate 
state interest to constitute eminent domain. Instead, the 
government agency’s action — in this case, demanding 
an easement as a condition of administratively granting a 
permit — leads to the taking of real estate and is inverse 
condemnation .
However, most California inverse condemnation cases filed 
by owners fail. California courts do not want to burden local 
governments with the obligation of paying for any diminution 
of property values which result each time it regulates or 
downgrades the use of real estate. [First English Evangelical 
Lutheran Church of Glendale v. County of Los Angeles (1989) 
210 CA3d 1353]Eminent Domain, the Power to Tax and Escheat           61Here, the ordinance imposing the inspection fee on landlords based 
on a flat rate per unit offered for rent is enforceable. Voter approval 
is only required when fees and taxes are imposed on owners simply 
because they own real estate. Fees and taxes imposed on the owner’s 
exercise of his uses and rights which come with owning the property 
do not require voter approval. [Apartment Association of Los Angeles 
v. City of Los Angeles  (2001) 24 C4th 830]
The power of escheat
The last constitutional power is escheat. 
Escheat occurs when the owner of a property dies, and they have no 
heirs to inherit it. When this occurs, ownership of the property reverts 
automatically to the state.   
Escheat also refers to the process of transferring abandoned property 
to the state, whether or not the rightful owner is still alive. 
For example, banks possessing an individual’s property (read: money) 
have a duty to return the property to the owner after three years of 
inactivity. [California Code of Civil Procedure §1513(a)(a)(A)]
Intangible personal property escheats to the state when:
• the last known address of the apparent owner is in California;
• no address of the apparent owner appears on the records of the 
holder and:
 ◦the last known address of the apparent owner is in California; 
or
 ◦the holder resides in California and has not previously paid 
the property to the state of the last known address of the 
apparent owner; or
 ◦the holder is part of California’s government and has not 
previously paid the property to the state of the last known 
address of the apparent owner;
• the last known address of the apparent owner is in a state that 
does not provide by law for the escheat of such property and 62         Video Renewal Course: Real Estate Made Reel™the holder is:
 ◦domiciled in this state; or 
 ◦a government or governmental subdivision or agency of 
this state; or
• the last known address of the apparent owner is in a foreign 
nation and the holder is:
 ◦domiciled in this state; or 
 ◦a government or governmental subdivision or agency of 
this state. [CCP §1510]
Holders of unclaimed property have a duty to notify owners of 
unclaimed property valued over $50 before reporting it to the state. 
[CCP §1520(b)]
One can access the public interface on the website of the State 
Controller’s office to determine whether the state holds any unclaimed 
property that has been escheated to the state after a period of 
inactivity.
Just as one regularly checks their credit score, brokers and other small 
business owners ought to make it a habit to periodically determine 
whether they have any unclaimed property with the state so they 
may get it back.Eminent Domain, the Power to Tax and Escheat           631. Eminent domain is the right of the government to take private 
property for public use.  The process of using the power of eminent 
domain is called: 
a. reversion. 
b. condemnation. 
c. dedication. 
2. An ordinance which imposes a regulatory fee on property is an 
example of the:
a. police power.
b. power of eminent domain.
c. power to tax.
3. Escheat occurs when an owner of a property dies:
a. and they have no heirs to inherit it, causing the property to 
revert to the state.   
b. and their will indicates title to the properly will be held by multiple 
heirs in unequal proportion. 
c. and their heirs attempt to cheat the state out of the property 
taxes due on the property.  64         Video Renewal Course: Real Estate Made Reel™
When federal and state law conflicts  
The federal government’s authority to regulate real estate also comes 
from the U.S. Constitution.  
Like the state, the federal government has the power to tax and the 
power to take private property for public use. [U.S. Const., Amend. 
XVI; Calif. Const., Art. 1 §19]
However, the federal government has no police power. In its place, 
the federal government has a powerful clause to regulate areas of 
national concern, called the commerce clause.  
The federal government has the right to regulate all commercial 
enterprises which affect interstate commerce.  
Originally, the clause was designed to combat attempts by local states 
to pass protectionist laws under their police powers which would inhibit 
the flow of goods between states — interstate commerce . [Gibbons 
v. Ogden (1824) 22 US 1]
Today, the clause also applies to local and intrastate activities which 
have an indirect effect on the flow of goods, services and people 
from state to state.  When federal and state law conflicts       65For example, the federal government’s interest in the flow of commerce 
between states outweighs a motel owner’s right to exclude specific 
classes of patrons. The owner’s exclusion interferes with the flow of 
commerce – which includes the mobility of people. [Heart of Atlanta 
Motel, Inc. v. United States (1964) 379 US 241]
The federal government’s ability to regulate a purely local activity 
even extends to local real estate brokers’ activities within their trade 
unions.  
For example, a broker sues the local board of realtors for federal 
antitrust violations, claiming the association fixes rates charged by its 
members for their services.  
The association ostracizes brokers who refuse to comply with the 
fee-setting policies established by the association based on the 
maintenance of a minimum acceptable level of income for its union 
members.  
The association claims the federal government may not regulate 
their activities as their services are purely local and have no effect on 
interstate commerce.  
Do the federal antitrust laws cover local brokerage activities?  
Yes! The association’s fee-setting of the charges for their members’ 
services affects housing locally, which in turn affects the desire to live 
in the area, which in turn affects the mobility of people in interstate 
commerce. [McLain v. Real Estate Board of New Orleans, Inc. (1980) 
444 US 232]
Alternatively, states have 
the sovereignty to regulate 
within their own borders. At 
the same time, the federal 
government has the right 
to regulate local activities 
affecting commerce.  
66         Video Renewal Course: Real Estate Made Reel™What happens when federal and state law conflict? Consider the 
following example.  
An airport is established under the Federal Aviation Act of 1953. The 
airport expands its number of late-night and early-morning flights. The 
residents around the airport complain of the noise during late and 
early hours.  
The city where the airport is located passes an ordinance restricting 
the number of flights between 11 p.m. and 7 a.m.  
The airport objects, claiming it was established under the sole jurisdiction 
of federal law and the Federal Aviation Act of 1953 set forth by the 
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) which has no restriction on flights 
between 11 p.m. and 7 a.m.  
Does the federal law preempt (supersede) state law?  
Yes! The goals of national flight service and the role of the FAA 
outweigh local laws inhibiting flight times. [City of Burbank v. Lockheed 
Air Terminal, Inc.  (1973) 411 US 624]
A federal law will preempt state and local statutes and ordinances 
when:  
• federal interests outweigh local interests;  
• the federal law is so pervasive as to exclude inconsistent state 
law; and  
• inconsistent treatment nationwide would result if state law 
controls.  
Thus, it is possible for federal and state law to regulate the same real 
estate activity.  
For example, federal and state fair housing laws prohibiting 
discrimination exist. Both the state and federal governments can 
regulate fair housing. The state may provide more, but may not allow 
less, protection than the federal law. [Calif. Civil Code §51]When federal and state law conflicts       671. The federal government’s authority to regulate real estate comes 
from:
a. the California Constitution. 
b. the U.S. Constitution. 
c. Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo.
2. The federal government has the right to regulate all commercial 
enterprises which affect:
a. interstate commerce.
b. local zoning and planning. 
c. the price of available goods on the open market.  
3. Which of the following statements is the most correct concerning 
the overlap of federal and state law?
a. Federal law always supersedes state law, unless the law is 
unique to the state. 
b. The state may provide more, but may not allow less, protection 
than the federal law.
c. A federal law will preempt state and local statutes and 
ordinances when the state interests outweigh federal interests.  Fee vs. Leasehold             69
Fee vs. Leasehold
Ownership interests held in real estate
Real estate, sometimes legally called real property or realty, consists 
of:  
• the land;  
• the improvements and fixtures attached to the land; and  
• all rights incidental or belonging to the property. [Calif. Civil Code 
§658]
A parcel of real estate is located by circumscribing its legal description 
on the “face of the earth.” Based on the legal description, a surveyor 
locates and sets the corners and surface boundaries of the parcel. 
The legal description is contained in deeds, subdivision maps or 
government surveys relating to the property.  
All permanent structures, crops and timber are part of the parcel of 
real estate. The parcel of real estate also includes buildings, fences, 
trees, watercourses and easements within the parcel’s boundaries.70         Video Renewal Course: Real Estate Made Reel™A parcel of real estate is three dimensional. In addition to the surface 
area within the boundaries, a parcel of real estate consists of:
• the soil below the parcel’s surface to the core of the earth, 
including water and minerals; and
• the air space above it to infinity. 
In the case of a statutory condominium unit, the air space enclosed 
within the walls is the real estate conveyed and held by the fee owner 
of the unit. The structure, land and air space outside the unit are the 
property of the homeowners’ association (HOA) .
The ownership interests a person may hold in real estate are called  
estates. Four types of estates exist in real estate:  
• fee estates, also known as fee simple estates, inheritance estates,  
perpetual estates, or simply, the fee ;  
• life estates ;  
• leasehold estates, sometimes called leaseholds, or estates for 
years; and  
• estates at will , also known as tenancies-at-will. [CC §761]
In practice, these estates are separated into three categories: 
fee estates, life estates and leasehold estates. Estates at will are 
considered part of the leasehold estates category. Leasehold estates 
are controlled by landlord/tenant law. 
Fee estates: unbundling the rights   
A person who holds a fee estate interest in real estate is a fee owner. 
In a landlord/tenant context, the fee owner is the landlord. 
Editor’s note — If a sublease exists on a commercial property, the 
master tenant is the “landlord” of the subtenant. 
A fee owner has the right to possess and control their property 
indefinitely. A fee owner’s possession is exclusive and absolute. 
Thus, the owner has the right to deny others permission to cross their 
boundaries. No one can be on the owner’s property without their 
consent, otherwise they are trespassing. The owner may recover any Ownership interests held in real estate          71money losses caused by the trespass.  
Exclusive right to use and enjoy
A fee owner has the exclusive right to use and enjoy the property. As 
long as local ordinances such as building codes and zoning regulations 
are obeyed, a fee owner may do as they please with their property. 
A fee owner may build new buildings, tear down old ones, plant trees 
and shrubs, grow crops or simply leave the property unattended.  
A fee owner may occupy, sell, lease or encumber  their parcel of real 
estate, give it away or pass it on to anyone they choose on their death. 
The fee estate is the interest in real estate transferred in a real estate 
sales transaction, unless a lesser interest such as an easement or life 
estate is noted.  However, one cannot transfer an interest greater than 
they received.
A fee owner is entitled to the land’s surface and anything permanently 
located above or below it. [CC §829]
The ownership interests in one parcel may be separated into several 
fee interests. One person may own the mineral rights beneath the 
surface, another may own the surface rights, and yet another may 
own the rights to the air space. Each solely owned interest is held in 
fee in the same parcel.   
In most cases, one or more individuals own the entire fee and lease 
the rights to extract underground oil or minerals to others. Thus, a fee 
owner can convey a leasehold estate in the oil and minerals while 
retaining their fee interest. The drilling rights separated from the fee 
ownership are  called profit a prendre. [Rousselot v. Spanier (1976) 60 
C3d 238]
Profit a prendre  is the right to remove profitable materials from property 
owned and possessed by another. If the profit a prendre is created by 
a lease agreement, it is a type of easement. [Gerhard v. Stephens 
(1968) 68 C2d 864]72         Video Renewal Course: Real Estate Made Reel™1. A parcel of real estate is most precisely located by circumscribing 
its __________ on the face of the earth.
a. property address

c. The air space enclosed within the walls.
3. The right to remove profitable materials from property owned and

c. profit a prendre.Life estates           73
Life estates
A life estate is an interest in a parcel of real estate lasting the lifetime of  
an individual, usually the life of the tenant. Life estates, also known as 
estates for life , are granted by a deed entered into by the fee owner, 
an executor under a will or by a trustee under an inter vivos trust.  
Life estates are commonly established by a fee owner who wishes 
to provide a home or financial security for another person (the life 
tenant) during that person’s lifetime, called the controlling life.  
For example, consider the fee owner of a vacation home who has an 
elderly relative who needs a place to live. The fee owner grants the 
relative a life estate in the vacation home for the 
duration of their lifetime. The relative may live there 
for the rest of their life, even if they outlive the fee 
owner who granted them the life estate.
Life estates terminate on the death of the 
controlling life. Life estates may also be terminated 
by agreement or by merger of different ownership 
interests in the property.  The holder of a life estate 
may not impair the fee interest. [Calif. Civil Code 
§818]74         Video Renewal Course: Real Estate Made Reel™1. A(n) __________ is an interest in a parcel of real estate lasting the 
lifetime of an individual.
a. fee estate
b. freehold estate
c. life estate
2. Under a life estate, the individual who possesses a property owned 
by the fee owner is referred to as the:
a. holdover tenant. 
b. life tenant. 
c. adverse possessor. 
3. Life estates terminate:
a. on the death of the controlling life.
b. on the death of the fee owner.  
c. within 15 years from inception. Leasehold estates held by tenants           75
Leasehold estates held by tenants
Leasehold estates, or tenancies, are the result of rights conveyed to a 
tenant by a fee owner (or by the life estate tenant or master lessee) to 
possess a parcel of real estate. 
Tenancies are created when the landlord and the tenant enter into 
a rental or lease agreement that conveys a possessory interest in the 
real estate to the tenant.  
A lease is for a fixed term, for instance, one year. [See RPI Form 550]
A rental agreement concerns a term 
that is not fixed, but periodic. [See RPI 
Form 551]
Both create a leasehold estate held the 
by a tenant. The tenant becomes the 
owner of a leasehold with the right to 
possess and use the entire property until 
the lease expires. The ownership and title 
to the fee interest in the property remains 
with the landlord throughout the term of 
the leasehold. The landlord’s fee interest 
76         Video Renewal Course: Real Estate Made Reel™is subject to the tenant’s right of possession, which is carved out of the 
fee by the lease or rental agreement.  
In exchange for the right to occupy and use the property, the landlord 
is entitled to rental income from the tenant during the period of the 
tenancy.
1. Tenancies are created when the landlord and the tenant enter into 
a rental or lease agreement that conveys a(n) __________ interest 
in the real estate to the tenant.  
a. ownership
b. possessory
c. fee
2. A rental agreement:
a. is for a fixed term, for instance, one year.
b. concerns a term that is not fixed, but periodic.
c. c. is used exclusively for transient occupancy units. 
3. In exchange for a tenant’s right to occupy and use a rental 
property, the landlord is entitled to:
a. rental income from the tenant during the period of the tenancy.
b. interest income from the tenant on all deposits held on expiration 
of the tenancy.
c. passive income from the appreciated value of the improved 
real estate. Types of leaseholds          77
Types of leaseholds
Four types of leasehold estates exist and can be held by tenants. The 
interests are classified by the length of their term:  
• a fixed-term tenancy, simply known as a lease and legally called 
an estate for years ; 
• a periodic tenancy, usually referred to as a rental;  
• a tenancy-at-will , previously introduced as an estate at will ; and 
• a tenancy-at-sufferance, commonly called a holdover tenancy.  
A fixed-term tenancy lasts for a specific length of time as stated in a 
lease agreement entered into by a landlord and tenant. On expiration 
of the lease term, the tenant’s right of possession automatically 
terminates unless it is extended or renewed by another agreement, 
such as an option agreement. [See RPI Form 550]
Periodic tenancies also last for a specific length of time, such as a 
week or a month. Under a periodic tenancy, the landlord and tenant 
agree to automatic successive rental periods of the same length of 
time, such as in a month-to-month tenancy, until terminated by notice 
by either the landlord or the tenant. [See RPI Form 551]
In a tenancy-at-will (also known as an estate at will ) the tenant has 78         Video Renewal Course: Real Estate Made Reel™the right to possess a property with the consent of the fee owner. 
Tenancies-at-will can be terminated at any time by an advance 
notice from either the landlord or the tenant or as set by agreement. 
Tenancies-at-will do not have a fixed duration, are usually not in writing 
and a rent obligation generally does not exist.  
A tenancy-at-sufferance occurs when a tenant retains possession of 
the rented premises after the tenancy granted terminates. 
1. An occupancy agreement that is entered into for a specific length 
of time is most likely a: 
a. rental agreement. 
b. lease agreement. 
c. tenancy-at-will.
2. Which type of occupancy agreement is least likely to require the 
payment of rent? 
a. Lease agreement. 
b. Rental agreement. 
c. Tenancy-at-will.
3. A(n) __________ occurs when a tenant retains possession of the 
rented premises after the tenancy granted terminates. 
a. estate at will
b. tenancy-at-will
c. tenancy-at-sufferanceLeaseholds conveying special uses        79
 Leaseholds conveying special uses
 In addition to the typical residential and commercial leases, you will 
find special use  leases.  
Oil, gas, water and mineral leases convey the right to use mineral 
deposits below the earth’s surface.  
The purpose of an oil lease is to discover and produce oil or gas. The 
lease is a tool used by the fee owner of the property to develop and 
realize the wealth of the land. The tenant provides the money and 
machinery for exploration, development and operations.  
The tenant pays the landlord rent, called a royalty. The tenant then 
keeps any profits from the sale of oil or minerals the tenant extracts 
from beneath the surface of the parcel.  
A ground lease on a parcel of real estate is granted to a tenant in 
exchange for the payment of rent. In a ground lease, rent is based on 
the rental value of the land in the parcel, whether the parcel is vacant 
or improved. Fee owners of vacant, unimproved land use leases to 
induce others to acquire an interest in the property and develop it.  
An original tenant under a ground lease constructs their own 
improvements. Typically, the tenant encumbers their possessory 80         Video Renewal Course: Real Estate Made Reel™interest in a ground lease with a trust deed lien to provide security for 
a construction loan.  
Master leases benefit fee owners who want the financial advantages 
of renting fully improved multi-tenant property, but do not want the 
day-to-day obligations and risks of managing the property.
For instance, the fee owner of a shopping center and a prospective 
owner-operator agree to a master lease.  
Another type of special-use lease is the farm lease, sometimes called 
a cropping agreement  or grazing lease. Here, the tenant operates 
the farm and pays the landlord either a flat fee rent or a percentage 
of the value of the crops or livestock produced on the land. Leaseholds conveying special uses        811. Oil, gas, water and mineral leases which convey the right to use 
mineral deposits below the earth’s surface are an example of a(n): 
a. prescriptive easement.
b. special use lease. 
c. royalty agreement.
2. In a(n) __________, rent is based on the rental value of the land in 
the parcel, whether the parcel is vacant or improved.  
a. farm lease
b. fixed-term lease 
c. ground lease
3. Under a(n) __________, the tenant operates a farm and pays the 
landlord either a flat fee rent or a percentage of the value of the 
crops or livestock produced on the land. 
a. land lease

c. farm lease82         Video Renewal Course: Real Estate Made Reel™
The rights of others in a property
Easements and use licenses are not real estate but they give a holder 
of the rights a limited and nonexclusive use of someone else’s property. 
An easement is a right to use another’s property for a specific purpose. 
An easement is an interest held in someone else’s real estate. It grants 
its holder the right to limit the activities of others on the property 
burdened by the easement, including the owner of the burdened 
property. [Calif. Civil Code §§801 et seq.]
For example, a landowner holds an easement allowing them to 
construct and have access to a pipeline across their neighbor’s 
property. The neighbor’s right to develop their own property is limited 
since the neighbor may do nothing to interfere with the easement 
owner’s access to the pipeline.
A license grants its holder a personal privilege to use property, but 
no possessory right to occupy it to the exclusion of others. Unlike 
easements, licenses are not exclusive rights — an owner may give 
many licenses to per-form the same or different activity in the same 
area.
Unlike an easement, a license may be revoked at the will of the The rights of others in a property            83person who grants it, unless agreed to the contrary or it has become 
irrevocable.   
Rights in another’s property
The most common easement is used for ingress and egress. An 
easement for ingress and egress creates a right of way allowing one 
property owner to traverse a portion of another’s land to access their 
property.  
An easement creates a tenement relationship between two parcels 
of real estate since it: 
• benefits one property, referred to as the dominant tenement, 
whose owner is entitled to use the easement; and  
• burdens another property, referred to as the servient tenement, 
the owner’s use of which is subject to the easement.  
When an owner whose property is burdened by an easement interferes 
with the use of the easement by a neighbor whose property benefits 
from the easement, the neighbor is entitled to have the use of the 
easement reinstated. The easement is reinstated by either removal, 
relocation or modification of the interference.  
Further, the neighbor who holds the easement is entitled to 
compensation for their money losses caused by the servient tenement 
owner’s obstruction of the neighbor’s use of the easement. [Moylan v. 
Dykes (1986) 181 CA3d 561] 
Appurtenant or in gross: does the easement run? 
An easement burdening an owner’s property as an encumbrance on 
their title is classified as either:  
• an appurtenant easement, meaning the allowed use belongs 
to and benefits an adjacent property and  is said to run with the 
land as an interest the adjacent property holds in the burdened 
real estate; or  
• an easement in gross, meaning it belongs to an individual, not 
84         Video Renewal Course: Real Estate Made Reel™land, as their personal right  to a specified use of the burdened 
real estate.  
An appurtenant easement is incidental to the title of the property 
which benefits from its use. An easement is not reflected as a recorded 
interest on the title to the parcel of land it benefits. Nor is it a personal 
right held by a particular individual who may now or have previously 
owned the parcel benefiting from the easement.  
Accordingly, an appurtenant easement is recorded as an 
encumbrance  on title to the burdened property. The easement remains 
on the property’s title after a conveyance to new owners of either the 
benefitting or burdened property. To be enforceable, the easement 
does not need to be referenced in the grant deed conveying either 
property to new owners since it runs with the land. [Moylan,  Moylan, 
supra]  
Conversely, an easement in gross benefits a particular person – not the 
real estate owned by that person. An easement in gross is personally 
held only by the individual who may use the easement. No parcel 
of real estate may benefit from an easement in gross since only the 
individual holding the easement can benefit.  
An easement in gross is a personal right that is not transferred with the 
sale of real estate owned by the holder of the easement. However, the 
right can be transferred  by the easement holder to another person by 
a writing — unless the transfer of the easement in gross is prohibited by 
a provision in the document creating the easement. [LeDeit v. Ehlert 
(1962) 205 CA2d 154] 
Binding on all future owners 
Covenants, conditions and restrictions (CC&Rs), collectively called 
encumbrances , are recorded against title to a property and limit an 
owner’s right to use their property. By recording restrictions against the 
title to real estate on a sale, a seller may prohibit certain uses of the 
property, or require the property be used for specific purposes only. 
Regulations governing how a condominium owner may use their unit The rights of others in a property            85and the rights and responsibilities of the common interest development 
(CID) are typically contained in a declaration of CC&Rs filed with the 
condominium subdivision plan.  
The CC&Rs bind all future owners to comply with the CC&Rs since the 
use restrictions they contain run with title to the land.

The Tenancies in Real Estate
Tenancies as leasehold estates
Different types of tenancies and properties trigger different termination 
procedures for the landlord, and different rights and obligations for 
the tenant. 
Leasehold estates, or tenancies, are possessory interests in real estate. 
Four types of tenancies exist:  
• fixed-term tenancies ;
• periodic tenancies;
• tenancies-at-will; and
• tenancies-at-sufferance , also called holdover tenancies.
To initially establish a tenancy, a landlord transfers to the tenant the 
right to occupy the real estate. This right is conveyed either in a writing, 
orally or by the landlord’s conduct, called a grant. If the landlord 
does not transfer by grant the right to occupy, the person who takes 
possession as the occupant is a trespasser.  
Fixed-term tenancies, periodic tenancies and tenancies at will have 88         Video Renewal Course: Real Estate Made Reel™agreed-to termination dates, or can be terminated by notice. 
A holdover tenancy occurs when a tenant continues in possession of 
the property after their right to occupy has expired. This holdover of 
possession without a contractual right is called an unlawful detainer 
(UD).
A landlord needs to file a judicial UD action to have a holdover 
tenant evicted. To be evicted, a tenant’s right of possession under 
the tenancy granted is to first be terminated either by service of the 
proper notice or expiration of the lease. Plainly speaking, the tenant 
needs to unlawfully retain possession of the property before the tenant 
can be evicted for unlawful detainer.
The type of notice required to terminate a tenancy, other than a 
fixed-term lease, depends on the period of the tenancy, length of the 
occupancy and location of the property (e.g., rent control). [Colyear 
v. Tobriner (1936) 7 C2d 735]Tenancies as leasehold estates          891. When a landlord does not transfer the right to occupy a property 
to a person by grant, the person who takes possession as the 
occupant is classified as a(n):
a. short-term tenant. 
b. trespasser.  
c. subtenant.  
2. A holdover of possession of real estate without a contractual right 
to do so is most accurately called a(n):
a. trespass. 
b. nuisance. 
c. unlawful detainer (UD).
3. Which of the following statements is most correct? 
a. To be evicted, a tenant’s right of possession under the tenancy 
granted is to first be terminated by unlawful detainer.
b. To initially establish a tenancy, a landlord transfers to the tenant 
the right to own the underlying real estate.
c. A tenant needs to unlawfully retain possession of the property 
before the tenant can be evicted for unlawful detainer.90         Video Renewal Course: Real Estate Made Reel™
The fixed-term tenancy
A fixed-term tenancy, also called a lease or estate for years, is the result 
of an agreement between the landlord and the tenant for a fixed 
rental period, also called the lease term. If the rental period is longer 
than one year, the lease arrangement is required to be in writing and 
signed by the tenant to be enforceable under the Statute of Frauds. 
The written document which sets the terms for rent and conditions for 
occupancy creating a fixed-term tenancy is called a lease agreement. 
[See RPI Form 550]
A lease agreement  is required to have a commencement date and 
an expiration date. [Calif. Civil Code §§761, 1624] 
During the term of the lease, the tenancy can only be terminated and 
the tenant evicted for good cause. Even then, service of a three-day 
notice to vacate the property (or if curable to cure the breach) is 
required. [See RPI Form 576]
Editor’s note – Different eviction rules apply if the property is subject 
to Just Cause eviction requirements. This content will be covered in a 
subsequent section. 
Without the tenant’s exercise of any option to renew or extend, a The fixed-term tenancy           91fixed-term tenancy automatically terminates on the expiration date, 
no notice required. [Calif. Code of Civil Procedures §1161(1)]
If a renewal or extension option exists, the lease is renewed or extended 
by the tenant’s exercise of the option or the landlord’s acceptance of 
rent called for in the option. [CC §1945] 
FOR RENT
Extended fixed-term lease is not a periodic tenancy
A landlord and tenant orally enter into a six-month lease 
agreement.  Rent for the period is payable monthly. On 
expiration of the six month lease, the landlord and tenant 
orally agree to extend the lease for another six-month period. 
At the end of the extended term, the tenant refuses to 
vacate, claiming the landlord must first serve them with a 
notice to vacate. 
92         Video Renewal Course: Real Estate Made Reel™Here, the tenant is not entitled to any further notice beyond 
the agreed-to termination date. The oral occupancy 
agreement did not create a periodic tenancy, even though 
it called for monthly rent payments. Instead, the agreement 
to extend the occupancy created a fixed-term lease with a 
set expiration date. 
Thus, the tenant’s right of possession terminated without 
further notice on expiration of the orally conveyed six-month 
period of occupancy, the rent for which was payable 
monthly. The oral lease agreement was enforceable since 
it was for a term less than one year. [Camp v. Matich (1948) 
87 CA2d 660]
A fixed-term tenancy provides a tenant with several advantages: 
• the right to occupy for the fixed term;  
• a predetermined rental amount; and 
• limitations on termination or modification.    
However, a fixed-term tenancy also has disadvantages for the fixed-
term tenant:  
• the tenant is liable for the total amount of rent due over the entire 
term of the lease (less rent paid by any replacement tenant 
located by the landlord to mitigate losses); 
• the tenant may not vacate prior to expiration of the rental period; 
and
• the tenant may not assign or sublet the premises to a new tenant 
if prohibited by provisions in the lease agreement.
The lease agreement 
The Residential Lease Agreement published by RPI (Realty Publications, 
Inc.) is a fixed-term lease agreement  used by a leasing agent, property The fixed-term tenancy           93manager or landlord when leasing a residential property on a fixed 
rental-rate basis for a specific period of time, to grant the tenancy 
and set the terms for rent and conditions for maintenance.
The Residential Lease Agreement:
• sets the amount of rents to be paid;
• identifies who will provide and pay for utilities; and
• allocates the maintenance responsibilities and their costs 
between the landlord and tenant. [See RPI Form 550]
• [Form 550]
Conditions imposed on a residential occupancy
Residential tenants typically provide a security deposit to the landlord 
to cover any cost to clean the unit or remedy any damage caused 
to the unit beyond reasonable wear and tear. [See RPI Form 550 §2]
In return for the use and possession of the premises, the tenant pays 
the landlord rent until expiration of the lease. The tenant agrees to 
pay a late charge  if rent is not paid on the due date, or within the 
established grace period . [See RPI Form 550 §4]
Also, a list of occupants who will reside in the property in addition to 
the named tenants is provided in the lease. Occupants are treated 
differently than guests. The number of guests the tenant may have in 
their unit, and the period of time over which their guests may visit, is 
limited. [See RPI Form 550 §§5.4 and 5.6]

• committing waste to the property. [See RPI Form 550 
§§6.8 and 6.9]
Even if a lease agreement does not restate these statutory 
prohibitions, a tenant who conducts any of these prohibited 
activities may be evicted by the landlord with the service 
of a three-day written notice to quit. Here, no alternative 
performance is available to the tenant. [Calif. Code of Civil 
Procedures §1161(4); see RPI Form 575 and 575-1]
Editor’s note – Different eviction rules apply if the property is 
subject to Just Cause eviction requirements. This content will 
be covered in a subsequent section. 
In the event the premises is totally or partially destroyed and 
becomes uninhabitable, either the landlord or tenant may 
terminate the lease by giving written notice. When the lease 
is not terminated, the landlord needs to repair the premises 
and prorate the rent for the period of time the premises is 
uninhabitable by the tenant. [See RPI Form 550 §8]The fixed-term tenancy           971. A lease arrangement is required to be in writing and signed by the

c. terminates on the landlord’s service of a 60-day notice to 
vacate in advance of the expiration date.98         Video Renewal Course: Real Estate Made Reel™
The periodic tenancy
If the landlord finds a fixed-term tenancy too restrictive or inflexible for 
their requirements, a periodic tenancy may be more suitable.
A periodic tenancy is automatically extended for equal, successive 
periods of time, such as a week or a month, until terminated by notice. 
The length of each successive period of time is determined by the 
interval between scheduled rental payments. 
Examples of periodic payment intervals include:  
• annual rental payments, indicating a year-to-year tenancy;  
• monthly rental payments, indicating a month-to-month tenancy; 
and 
• weekly rental payments, indicating a week-to-week tenancy.  
A periodic tenancy is intentionally created by a landlord and tenant 
entering into a rental agreement . A rental agreement is the agreement 
which sets the terms for payment of rent and conditions for possession 
under a periodic tenancy.

The Residential Rental Agreement :
• sets the amount of rents to be paid;
• identifies who will provide and pay for utilities; and
• allocates the maintenance responsibilities and their costs 
between the landlord and tenant. [ See RPI Form 551]
A periodic tenancy can also result due to possession under a 
defective lease agreement. A tenant who takes possession under an 
unenforceable lease agreement (e.g., oral, or unsigned) and pays 
rent in monthly intervals that the landlord accepts has entered into a 
month-to-month periodic rental agreement.
A periodic tenancy continues until terminated by a notice to vacate. 
This right to terminate a month-to-month tenancy by either the landlord 
or the tenant giving the other a notice to vacate makes a periodic 
tenancy flexible. [Kingston v. Colburn (1956) 139 CA2d 623; Calif. Civil 
Code §1946]
To terminate a periodic tenancy, the notice period is to be at least as 
long as the interval between scheduled rental payments, but need 
not exceed 30 days. A residential property exception exists: a 60-day 
notice is required to terminate a periodic tenancy in a dwelling if 
the tenant has occupied the property for more than 12 months. [CC 
§1946.1; see RPI Form 569-1]
On a material breach of the rental agreement, a three-day notice to 
vacate can also be used to terminate a periodic  tenancy. [See RPI 
Form 577]  
Editor’s note – Additional rules for terminating a tenancy may apply if 
the property is subject to “just cause” eviction requirements under the 
Tenant Protect Act . This will be covered in a later section. The periodic tenancy          101Safe, sanitary and fit for use
All residential rental and lease agreements carry an implied 
warranty of habitability  regardless of the provisions in the 
lease agreements. However, commercial leases do not 
contain an implied warranty of habitability.
The implied warranty requires the residential landlord to care 
for the premises by maintaining it in a habitable condition. 
A habitable condition is the minimum acceptable level of 
safety and sanitation permitted by law. [Hinson v. Delis (1972) 
26 CA3d 62; Calif. Code of Civil Procedure §1174.2]
Residential property which is not in a habitable condition 
cannot be rented or leased “as-is.” A property cannot be 
rented “as-is” even if defective property conditions have 
been fully disclosed  and consented to by the tenant.  
The public policy establishing the warranty of habitability was 
legislated due to landlord abuses during periods of scarcity 
in low-cost housing. This economic situation left residential 
tenants in lesser socioeconomic neighborhoods without the 
bargaining power possessed by more affluent and mobile 
tenants.  
Landlords breach the implied warranty of habitability when 
they fail to comply with building and housing code standards 
that materially affect health and safety. [CCP §1174.2(c)]
A habitable place to live is a dwelling free of major defects 
which would interfere with the tenant’s ability to use the 
premises as a residence. This definition does not include 
mere inconveniences.  
A residential dwelling is uninhabitable if any features of the 
dwelling are:
• not properly maintained; or102         Video Renewal Course: Real Estate Made Reel™• do not substantially comply with building and housing 
codes
To be habitable, a residential property needs to have:
• effective waterproofing and weather protection of roof 
and exterior walls, including unbroken windows and 
doors;  
• plumbing and gas facilities;  
• a hot and cold running water system with appropriate 
fixtures connected to a sewage disposal system;  
• heating facilities;  
• electrical lighting; and  
• floors, stairways and railings. [Calif. Civil Code §1941.1]
In applying these guidelines, a leaky faucet would not render 
a residential unit uninhabitable. However, lack of running 
water is a significant defect that materially interferes with the 
tenant’s ability to use the property as shelter.  
At the time the rental or lease agreement is entered into, the 
building grounds and appurtenances are to be clean and 
sanitary. This includes:
• the communal pool;
• laundry facilities;
• storage areas; and
• parking structures.The periodic tenancy          1031. If a landlord finds a fixed-term tenancy__________, a periodic

A closer look at a tenancy-at-will
Fixed-term and periodic tenancies are the most common type of 
leasehold estates. But there are others, such as a tenancy-at-will , also 
known as an estate at will .
The characteristics of a tenancy-at-will include:  
• the tenant possesses the property with the landlord’s knowledge 
and consent, frequently after the termination of a lease;  
• possession is provided for an indefinite and unspecified period 
of time; 
• there is no underlying rental or lease agreement, or the agreement 
has expired; and
• there is no provision for the payment of rent.  
A common example of a tenancy-at-will is when a family member 
allows another family member to live in their property without any 
type of agreement whatsoever and without paying any rent.
This meets all the criteria: possession is mutually agreed to, possession 
is indefinite, there is no underlying agreement documenting the 
arrangement, and the family member does not pay rent to the other 
family member.  A closer look at a tenancy-at-will           105Situations giving rise to a tenancy-at-will include:  
• when a tenant is granted the right to indefinitely occupy the 
property in exchange for services rendered [Covina Manor Inc. 
v. Hatch (1955) 133 CA2d Supp. 790; see  RPI Form 591];
• when a tenant is given possession of property under an 
unenforceable lease agreement (e.g., a written lease not 
signed by either party or on terms orally agreed to) — unless 
rent is accepted which creates a periodic tenancy [Psihozios v. 
Humberg (1947) 80 CA2d 215];  or
• when a tenant is given possession of the property while lease 
negotiations regarding the rent amount are still in progress and 
rent is not accepted. [ Miller  v. Smith (1960) 179 CA2d 114]
For a tenancy-at-will, a written three-day notice to pay rent or quit is 
all that is required to implement any change in the right to continue 
to occupy the premises – for instance, change it to a different kind of 
tenancy or terminate the tenancy. Contrast this with the more onerous 
notice requirements for terminating a periodic tenancy. 
Periodic tenancy or tenancy-at-will?
Consider a property manager who rents an apartment to a 
tenant under a fixed-term lease. At the end of the leasing 
period, the tenant retains possession and continues to pay 
rent monthly, which the property manager accepts. Later, 
the tenant is served with an appropriate notice to vacate. 
On the running of the notice period, the tenant refuses to 
vacate. 
The tenant claims the notice to vacate served by the landlord 
merely terminated the tenant’s right of possession and made 
it a tenancy-at-will on expiration of the notice. As a tenant-
at-will, they are entitled to an additional three-day notice to 
vacate before they are unlawfully detaining the property.106         Video Renewal Course: Real Estate Made Reel™However, an occupancy agreement for an indefinite term 
with a monthly rent schedule is a month-to-month tenancy. 
Thus, a tenant is only entitled to one notice to vacate which 
needs to expire before a UD action may be filed to evict 
them. [ Palmer v. Zeis (1944) 65 CA2d Supp. 859]
A resident manager’s occupancy
Relatedly, a tenancy-at-will  situation often presents itself in the context 
of a resident manager whose right to occupy a property is granted in 
exchange for providing property management services.  
Consider a broker who, retained to manage a residential income 
property, enters into an employment agreement with a resident 
manager to oversee the daily management of the property. This 
employment agreement is called a resident manager agreement. 
[See RPI Form 591]  
Under the resident manager agreement , the resident manager:  
• acknowledges employment by the property manager;  
• accepts the occupancy and use of an apartment unit rent-free 
as compensation for the employment; and  
• agrees to vacate the property on termination of employment.  
The resident manager’s job is to show vacant units, run credit checks, 
negotiate and sign leases, collect rents, supervise repairs and 
maintenance, serve notices and perform other non-discretionary 
administrative activities.  
Later, the property manager terminates the resident manager’s 
employment.  
The property manager demands the resident manager immediately 
vacate the premises and relinquish possession of the unit. 
However, the resident manager claims to be a tenant, entitled to a A closer look at a tenancy-at-will           107

and their right of possession of the unit. 
Is the resident manager entitled to a notice and time to vacate on 
termination of employment?   
No! A resident manager who continues to occupy a unit after 
their employment is terminated becomes a holdover tenant. They 
unlawfully detain the unit and have no right to a notice other than 
the notice terminating their employment. A resident manager’s 
occupancy is fixed, not periodic. It is established in the resident 
manager agreement that the resident manager’s tenancy ends on 
the date their employment is terminated. [Karz v. Mecham (1981) 120 
CA3d Supp. 1]
Also, the resident manager’s eviction by an unlawful detainer (UD) 
action is not protected by rent control ordinances. Further, they 
may not defend their continued possession by demanding the 
property manager or landlord show good cause for terminating their 
employment. [ Tappe v. Lieberman (1983) 145 CA3d Supp. 19]
If the resident manager does not relinquish possession on termination 
of the resident manager’s employment, the property manager may 
immediately file a UD action, without further notice, to have the 
resident manager evicted. 
However, a resident manager agreement may provide for the creation 
of a tenancy following the termination of a resident manager’s 
employment. When a tenancy is agreed to, the resident manager’s 
right of possession is not terminated on termination of the resident 
manager employment, but under landlord-tenant rules of notice 
before eviction. [Calif. Code of Civil Procedure §1161(1)]
A resident manager is an individual employed by the property manager 
or landlord to live on-site at the managed complex and see to its daily 
operations. A resident manager’s  duties may include:  
• screening tenants and negotiating leases;  
• cleaning vacated units;  A closer look at a tenancy-at-will           109• supervising landscaping, maintenance and repairs;  
• serving notices; or  
• attending to tenant inquiries.  
Both residential income property and commercial property may have 
resident managers. However, apartment buildings with 16 or more 
units are required to have a landlord, resident manager or responsible 
caretaker living on the premises to manage the property. [25 Calif. 
Code of Regulations §42]
Resident managers do not need to be licensed as a real estate 
broker or agent to negotiate leases or collect rents. However, if a 
nonresident property manager is not the landlord, the nonresident 
property manager needs to be licensed by the Department of Real 
Estate (DRE) as a real estate broker. [Calif. Business and Professions

The holdover tenancy
When a fixed-term or periodic tenancy terminates by prior agreement 
or notice, the tenant who remains in possession unlawfully detains the 
property from the landlord. Likewise, a tenant-at-will who receives the 
appropriate notice to vacate and who remains in possession of the 
property also unlawfully detains the property. These scenarios create a 
tenancy-at-sufferance, commonly referred to as a holdover tenancy. 
A holdover tenancy also arises on termination of a resident manager 
when the resident manager’s compensation includes the right to 
occupy a unit rent-free. When the landlord terminates the employment 
and the resident manager fails to vacate immediately, the resident 
manager unlawfully detains the premises as a holdover tenant. [Karz 
v. Mecham (1981) 120 CA3d Supp. 1; see RPI Form 591]
What steps does a landlord take to serve an 
unlawful detainer on a holdover tenant?
Facts: An apartment landlord filed an unlawful detainer 
(UD) against a tenant who was unlawfully holding over. The 
landlord attempted to personally serve the UD on the tenant 112         Video Renewal Course: Real Estate Made Reel™at the apartment address numerous times but the tenant was 
out of state. The landlord posted the notice on the property 
and mailed a copy to the tenant’s last known address, which 
was at the apartment. No other address for the tenant was 
available. The tenant did not receive or respond to the UD 
and the landlord took possession of the property.
Claim:  The tenant sought to restore their tenancy claiming 
the landlord’s attempts to serve the UD were deficient since 
all the attempts were executed at the apartment address 
while the tenant was out of state and no other actions were 
taken to reach the tenant.
Counterclaim:  The landlord sought to prevent the tenant 
from restoring their tenancy, claiming sufficient actions were 
taken to notify the tenant of the UD since multiple attempts 
to notify the tenant were executed at the apartment address 
without response before posting the notice on the premises 
and no other address for the tenant was available.
Holding: A California Court of Appeals held the tenant may 
not regain possession since personal service was attempted 
and the notice was posted at the apartment address and 
no other address for the tenant was available for personal 
service or mailing. [The Board of Trustees of the Leland 
Stanford Junior University  v. Ham (2013) 216 CA4th 330]
Editor’s note – A landlord is not required to expend an 
indeterminate amount of time and resources to track down 
an absent tenant in order to serve a UD. If the UD cannot be 
personally delivered, the landlord may leave a copy with a 
competent adult at the property or post it on the property, 
then send the documents by mail to the last known address 
of the tenant.The holdover tenancy         113Is a landlord liable for unintentional damage to a 
holdover tenant’s personal property?
Facts: A landlord leases a commercial property to a tenant. 
When the lease term expires, the landlord modifies the 
lease for a month-to-month tenancy, all of the other terms 
remaining the same. The tenant defaults on rent and is served 
with a three-day notice to pay rent or quit. The tenant fails A  holdover tenant retains possession of the premises without any 
contractual right to do so. Their tenancy has been terminated. Thus, 
the landlord is not required to provide a holdover tenant with any 
additional notice prior to commencing eviction proceedings. [Calif. 
Code of Civil Procedures §1161]
A holdover tenant  no longer owes rent under the expired lease or 
terminated rental agreement since they no longer have the right of 
possession. However, the rental or lease agreement usually includes 
a  holdover rent provision which calls for a penalty rate of daily rent 
owed for each day the tenant holds over. 
If the rental or lease agreement does not contain a holdover rent  
provision, the tenant owes the landlord the reasonable rental value of 
the property. This is a daily rate owed for each day the tenant holds 
over. [See RPI Form 550]
Holdover rent is not due and is not to be collected by the landlord 
until the tenant vacates or is evicted under an unlawful detainer (UD) 
action. On vacating, the holdover period is known and the amount 
owed can be determined, demanded and collected. If it is not paid 
on demand, rent can be collected by deducting it from any security 
deposit or obtaining a money judgment.
But a caution to landlords: acceptance of any holdover rent prior to 
a tenant vacating or being evicted by a UD action has unintended 
consequences.114         Video Renewal Course: Real Estate Made Reel™to pay rent or quit during the notice period and the landlord 
files an unlawful detainer (UD) action. The tenant vacates 
the property, but fails to remove their personal property from 
the premises.  After the expiration of the three-day notice 
period and during the UD action, the tenant’s personal 
property is damaged in a sewage spill. The tenant is later 
officially evicted under the UD action.
Claim:  The tenant seeks money losses caused by damage to 
their personal property, claiming the landlord is responsible 
for its lost value since the tenant was in lawful possession of 
the property at the time of the sewage spill as the UD action 
was still pending.
Counterclaim:  The landlord claims they are not responsible 
for the damage to the personal property since the tenant 
failed to remove it and had no right to possession of the 
premises when the sewage spill occurred due to their failure 
to pay rent under the three-day notice.
Holding: A California court of appeals holds the landlord 
is not responsible for the damage to the tenant’s personal 
property since the tenant failed to pay the delinquent rent 
under the three-day notice and was not in lawful possession 
of the premises when the sewage spill occurred. [Multani v. 
Knight (2018) 23 CA5th 837]
Editor’s note — The landlord properly demanded the tenant 
pay delinquent rent or vacate and surrender possession of 
the property by serving a three-day notice to pay rent or 
quit. Further, the rental agreement and the tenant’s right to 
possession were terminated on expiration of the three-day 
notice period, not when the UD action concluded. The holdover tenancy         1151. Which scenario creates a tenancy-at-sufferance? 
a. When a fixed-term tenancy terminates by prior agreement and 
the tenant remains in possession without the consent of the 
landlord.
b. When a tenant-at-will receives the appropriate notice to vacate 
and remains in possession without the consent of the landlord.
c. Both a. and b.
2. Prior to commencing eviction proceedings on a holdover tenant, 
the landlord is required to provide a holdover tenant:
a. a Three-Day Notice to Quit prior to commencing eviction

proceedings.
c. no additional notice prior to commencing eviction proceedings.

Changing the type of tenancy
A landlord, by using a  proper notice, can create a different tenancy 
relationship from the one they initially conveyed to the tenant. A 
tenant’s possessory interest in real estate can shift from one type of 
tenancy to another due to:  
• a notice;  
• expiration of a lease; or  
• by conduct.  
A classic example involves a change in the type of tenancy which 
arises when a holdover tenant becomes a month-to-month (periodic) 
tenant.  
A landlord who accepts any rent from a holdover tenant under an 
expired lease has elected by their conduct to treat the continued 
occupancy as a periodic tenancy. [Peter Kiewit Sons Co. v. Richmond 
Redevelopment Agency  (1986) 178 CA3d 435]
Thus, the prerequisite to a UD eviction is the service of a proper notice 
to vacate on the holdover tenant who paid rent for the continued 
occupancy, rent the landlord accepted to create a periodic tenancy. 
[Colyear v. Tobriner (1936) 7 C2d 735]Changing the type of tenancy            117If a landlord accepts rent from a holdover tenant after a fixed-term 
tenancy expires, the expired lease agreement is renewed on the same 
terms except for the period of occupancy, which is now periodic. 
[Calif. Civil Code §1945]
On expiration of a fixed-term lease, the landlord’s continued 
acceptance of rental payments does not renew the tenancy for 
another term equal to the term of the original lease. Rather, the 
tenancy is extended as a periodic tenancy for consecutive periods 
equal to the interval between rent payments — hence, one month if 
rent is paid monthly. [Calif. Civil Code §1945]
A landlord who wants to terminate a periodic tenancy they created 
by accepting rent after expiration of a lease needs to serve the tenant 
with the proper notice to vacate and let it expire. On expiration of 
the notice, the tenant who remains in possession of the premises is 
unlawfully detaining the premises and the landlord may file a UD 
action to evict them. 
Transient occupants and their removal
Another type of occupancy is to be differentiated from the leasehold 
interests discussed in this course. Transient occupancy  is the occupancy 
of a vacation property, hotel, motel, inn, boarding house, lodging 
house, tourist home or similar sleeping accommodation for a period 
of 30 days or less. This type of occupant is classified as a guest, also 
called a transient occupant.  
A transient occupant occupies property known as lodging, 
accommodation or unit, not space or premises. The property is not 
called a rental. The term “rental” implies a landlord/tenant relationship 
exists. Further, landlord/tenant law does not control transient 
occupancy.
The guest’s occupancy is labeled a stay, not possession. During a 
guest’s stay in the lodging, the owner or manager of the property is 
entitled to enter the unit at check-out time even though the guest 
may not yet have departed.  118         Video Renewal Course: Real Estate Made Reel™The contract entered into for the lodging is usually called a reservation 
agreement, but never a rental agreement or lease agreement. [See 
RPI Form 593]  
Guests pay a daily rate, not a daily or weekly rent. They arrive at a pre-
set date and time for check-in, not for commencement of possession. 
Likewise, guests depart at an hour on a date agreed to as the check-
out time. Unlike a tenant, a guest does not vacate the premises; they 
check out.
When a guest fails to depart at the scheduled check-out hour on 
the date agreed, no holdover tenancy is created. Thus, an unlawful 
detainer does not exist as with a tenancy conveyed by a rental or 
lease agreement. A UD action or court involvement is not required to 
remove the guest. [CC §1940(b)]
However, for the owner or manager to avoid the landlord-tenant UD 
eviction process, the guest, when checking in, needs to sign a notice 
stating:  
• the unit is needed at check-out time for another guest who has 
been promised the unit; and  
• if the guest has not departed at check-out time, the owner or 
manager may enter, take possession of the guest’s property, re-
key the doors and clean up the unit  for the next guest. [CC 
§1865; see RPI Form 593]  
Property manager’s self-help to remove guests
To remove a guest who fails to timely depart the unit and 
remains in the unit after a demand has been made to leave, 
the manager can intervene to remove the guest, a solution 
called self-help. If the manager’s intervention might cause a 
breach of the peace, the manager may call the police. The 
police or the sheriff will assist, without the need for a court Changing the type of tenancy            119order, to remove the guest and prevent a danger to persons 
or property during the re-keying, removal of possessions and 
clean up for the arrival of the next guest. [Calif. Penal Code 
§602(s)]
Transient occupancies include all occupancies that are 
taxed as such by local ordinance or could be taxed as such 
by the city or by the county.
Taxwise, the guest occupancy is considered a personal 
privilege, not a tenancy. Time share units when occupied 
by their owners are not transient occupancies and are not 
subject to those ordinances and taxes. [Calif. Revenue and 
Taxation Code §7280]
Transient units do not include residential hotels since the 
occupants of residential hotels treat the dwelling they 
occupy as their primary residence. Also, the occupancy of 
most individuals in residential hotels is for a period of more 
than 30 days.  
Also, the operator of a residential hotel may not require a 
resident to change units or to check out and re-register in 
order to avoid creating a month-to-month tenancy which 
would place the occupancy under landlord/tenant law. A 
residential hotel operator violating this rule is liable for a $500 
civil penalty and attorney fees. [CC §1940.1]
A broker or any other person who manages “vacation rental” 
stays for owners of single family homes, units in a common 
interest development (condominium project), units in an 
apartment complex or any other residence subject to a local 
transient occupancy tax, is to maintain accounting records.  
Further, the property manager needs to send a monthly 
accounting statement to each landlord they represent and 
make the records available for inspection and reproduction 120         Video Renewal Course: Real Estate Made Reel™by the owner. They need to also comply with the transient 
occupancy tax regarding collection, payment and record 
keeping. [CC §1864]Changing the type of tenancy            1211. A tenant’s possessory interest in real estate can shift from one type 
of tenancy to another due to:  
a. a notice, expiration of a lease or by conduct.  
b. expiration of a lease, subordination or by operation of law.
c. operation of law, a notice or by an extension of a lease.
2. A landlord who accepts any rent from a holdover tenant under an 
expired lease has elected by their conduct to treat the continued 
occupancy:
a. as an unlawful holdover.
b. as a periodic tenancy. 
c. as a fixed-term lease which runs from one year commencing 
on the data the landlord accepts payment. 
3. On expiration of a fixed-term lease, the landlord’s continued 
acceptance of rental payments:
a. renews the tenancy for another term equal to the term of the 
original lease.
b. does not renew the tenancy for another term equal to the term 
of the original lease.
c. creates an automatic holdover tenancy which may only be 
corrected by an unlawful detainer (UD) action. 122         Video Renewal Course: Real Estate Made Reel™
Other rules for terminating a tenancy
A landlord and tenant can establish a shorter or lengthier notice period 
by agreement. However, the notice period cannot be less than seven 
days. 
Other specialized rules exist for different types of properties and 
situations. For example, in a rent-controlled tenancy, terminating the 
right of possession is restricted by local ordinances.
In a tenancy-at-will in a mobile home park, the tenant needs to be 
given a 60-day written notice. [Calif. Civil Code §798.55(b)]
Industrial and commercial tenants typically require three months 
minimum notice due to the time spent receiving and responding to a 
notice since it goes through multiple tiers of corporate management 
before a decision can be made. [CC §1946]
In some instances, an extended 90-day notice is required to terminate 
residential tenancies in foreclosed properties.Other rules for terminating a tenancy           123Terminating a tenancy under the Tenant Protection 
Act (ACT)
The Tenant Protection Act (TPA) of 2019 made several 
significant changes to the rights of landlords and tenants of 
targeted properties including: 
• capping annual rent increases at 5% plus the rate of 
inflation for much of California multi-unit residential 
properties;  and
• requiring “just cause” to evict tenants in place for 12 
months or more. 
Requiring a just cause for eviction makes it harder for landlords 
to evict tenants in order to rent out their properties to new 
tenants at a higher rate. Further, if a tenant is being evicted 
at no fault of their own, the landlord may also be required to 
provide modest financial relocation assistance. 
The changes enacted will be effective until they are repealed 
on January 1, 2030. [Calif. Civil Code §1946.2(j)]
The applicability of the TPA is comprehensive, covering most 
multi-unit residential real estate housing in California and 
single family residential (SFR) units owned by a real estate 
investment trust (REIT), a corporation or a limited liability 
company (LLC) in which at least one member is a corporation. 
However, there are numerous, sizable exemptions for multi-
family units and conditions for SFRs to be excluded. 
Multi-unit residential real estate exempt from “just cause” 
eviction procedures include:
• residential units that have been issued a certificate of 
occupancy within the previous 15 years;
• a duplex of which the owner occupied one of the units 
as their principal residence at the beginning of the 124         Video Renewal Course: Real Estate Made Reel™tenancy and remains in occupancy;
• units restricted as affordable housing for households 
of very low or moderate income, or subject to an 
agreement that provides subsidies for affordable 
housing for households of very low, low, or moderate 
income;
• dormitories constructed and maintained in connection 
with any higher education institution in California;
• units subject to rent or price control that restricts annual 
increases in the rental rate to an amount less than that 
set by the TPA;
• multi-unit transient occupancy housing like hotels and 
motels;
• accommodations in which the tenant shares kitchen or 
bathroom facilities with an SFR owner-occupant;
• SFR real estate that can be sold and conveyed separate 
from the title to any other dwelling unit, like in an SFR 
subdivision or condominium project, provided:
• the owner is not one of the following:
• a real estate investment trust (REIT);
• a corporation; or
• a limited liability company (LLC) in which at 
least one member is a corporation; and
• the tenant has been given written notice stating the 
rental property is exempt from the rent increase caps 
under the TPA. [CC §1947.12(d); CC §1946.2(e); see 
RPI Form 550, 551 and 550-3]
To notify the tenant of the property’s exempt status from 
the TPA, the landlord uses a checkbox  in the rental or lease 
agreement to indicate whether the property is subject to just 
cause eviction requirements.Other rules for terminating a tenancy           125When a residential property or tenancy does not meet any 
of the criteria for exemption, the landlord is to abide by the 
TPA limiting their ability to increase the rent or evict a tenant 
to regain possession.
 “Just Cause” required for certain evictions
For tenancies commenced or renewed on or after July 1, 
2020, tenants are to be notified of the new “just cause” and 
rent cap protections extended to residential tenants by the 
TPA. 
The following statutory language is to be a provision in all 
residential and lease agreements, written in no less than 
12-point type: 
California law limits the amount your rent can be 
increased. See Section 1947.12 of the Civil Code for more 
information. California law also provides that after all of 
the tenants have continuously and lawfully occupied 
the property for 12 months or more or at least one of 
the tenants has continuously and lawfully occupied the 
property for 24 months or more, a landlord must provide 
a statement of cause in any notice to terminate a 
tenancy. See Section 1946.2 of the Civil Code for more 
information.
This is incorporated as a boilerplate notice of tenant rights into 
RPI Form 550 §10 and Form 551 §9, our residential occupancy 
agreements.
Landlords of property exempt from the TPA need to notify the 
tenant in writing of their exempt status to qualify themselves 
for the exemption. The landlord notifies the tenant by using 
a checkbox in the rental or lease agreement to indicate 
whether the property is subject to rent limits and just cause 
eviction requirements. [See RPI Form 550 §10.1 and Form 551 126         Video Renewal Course: Real Estate Made Reel™§9.1]
For tenancies entered into prior to July 1, 2020 which do not 
include the notice, the landlord will provide the notice and, 
if applicable, indicate their exempt status using the separate 
Just Cause and Rent Cap Addendum . [See RPI Form 550-3]
Landlords of non-exempt property seeking to evict tenants 
need to show just cause when:
• all tenants have continuously and lawfully occupied 
the unit for 12 months or longer; or
• at least one tenant has continuously and lawfully 
occupied the unit for 24 months or longer. [CC 
§1946.2(a)]
At-fault just cause evictions
Just cause eviction notices fall under two categories, based 
on whether the tenant is:
• at fault, called an at-fault just cause eviction [CC 
§1946.2(b)(1)]; or
• not at fault, called a no-fault just cause eviction. [CC 
§1946.2(b)(2)]
An at-fault just cause eviction is further categorized as either: 
• curable; or
• incurable.
To qualify for an at-fault just cause eviction, the tenant: 
• defaulted on a rental payment; 
• failed to enter into a landlord-requested renewal or 
extension  of a lease which terminated on or after 
January 1, 2020 [See RPI Form 565];
• breached a material term  of the lease;Other rules for terminating a tenancy           127• committed or permitted a nuisance or waste to occur 
on the property;
• conducted criminal activity  on the premises or common 
areas, or used the premises for an unlawful purpose; 
• assigned or sublet the premises in violation of the expired 
lease;
• refused the landlord’s authorized entry into the premises; 
or
• failed to deliver possession after providing the landlord 
notice to terminate  the tenancy or surrender possession. 
[CC §1946.2(b)(1); see RPI Form 576-1]
Also classified as an at-fault just cause eviction is a tenant’s 
failure to vacate when the tenant was a 3or other employee 
of the landlord and their occupancy was provided in 
conjunction with their employment status and limited to 
the period of employment, and the employment has been 
terminated. [CC §1946.2(b)(1)(K)]
Editor’s note — When occupancy under a lease agreement 
expires, a landlord may require the tenant to enter into a 
written extension or renewal, rather than allow the tenancy 
to remain, converting the fixed-term tenancy to a periodic 
month-to-month tenancy. However, if the tenant fails to 
enter into a lease renewal or extension agreement and the 
landlord has not accepted rent for a holdover period, this is 
considered an at-fault just cause for eviction. [CC §1946.2(b)
(1)(E)]
When the tenant under an at-fault just cause tenancy 
breaches a nonmonetary performance provision of a rental 
or lease agreement, the landlord of a non-exempt property 
serves the tenant a Three-Day Notice to Perform – For 
Properties Subject to Just Cause Eviction Requirements . [See 
RPI Form 576-1]128         Video Renewal Course: Real Estate Made Reel™When the failure to perform is incurable – such as when a 
tenant commits waste to the property or engages in overt 
criminal activity – the landlord uses the Three-Day Notice to 
Quit, requiring the tenant to vacate and deliver possession 
within three days of service. [Calif. Code of Civil Procedure 
§1161(4); see RPI Form 577-1]
However, when the failure to perform is curable, such as the 
breach of a lease term which may be fully corrected within 
a three day period, the landlord uses the Three-Day Notice 
to Perform  to state what the tenant needs to do to rectify 
or cure the breach in order to remain in possession. [See RPI 
Form 576-1 §4]
Unique to properties subject to the just cause eviction 
requirements, when the tenant does not cure the breach by 
full performance within three days after service of the notice 
to perform, the landlord may not immediately begin legal 
proceedings to regain possession by pursuing an unlawful 
detainer (UD) action.
Rather, if the breach remains uncured on expiration of the 
Notice to Perform, the landlord is required to prepare and 
serve the tenant with the Three-Day Notice to Quit. [CC 
§1946.2(c); see RPI Form 577-1]
Here, the tenant who is served a notice to correct a curable 
breach and fails to fully perform or quit, is given three 
additional days to vacate — quit — after service of the final 
notice. When the tenant then fails to vacate and deliver 
possession, the landlord’s remaining legal remedy is to file 
a UD action to regain possession based on the tandem quit 
notices and seek an award for rent owed and associated 
costs. [CC §1946.2(c)]
Related, when the tenant commits a curable monetary 
breach, in order to initiate the eviction, the landlord uses a Other rules for terminating a tenancy           129Three-Day Notice to Pay Rent (with or without related fees). 
These notices include sections which identify the tenant as 
being under a lease which requires just cause to terminate 
the tenancy and indicates their failure to pay rent constitutes 
just cause for eviction. [See RPI Form 575-3 and Form 575-4]
Once the three days have passed and the tenant has still 
not paid the appropriate amount(s) – a curable breach – 
the landlord may serve the tenant with a Three-Day Notice 
to Quit without the further opportunity to cure the violation. 
[See RPI Form 577-1]
No-fault just cause evictions 
A no-fault just cause eviction exists when the tenant is being 
evicted under no fault of their own for any of the following 
reasons:
• the landlord or their spouse, domestic partner, children, 
grandchildren, parents or grandparents intent to 
occupy the premises;
• the property is withdrawn from the rental market;
• the property is unfit for habitation as determined by a 
government agency and through no fault of the tenant; 
or 
• the landlord intends to demolish or substantially renovate 
the property. [CC 1946.2 (b)(2); see RPI Form 569-2 §3]
An improvement qualifies as a substantial remodel or 
renovation when any structural, electrical, plumbing or 
mechanical system is replaced or substantially modified, 
requiring a permit from a government agency. This includes 
the abatement of hazardous materials like lead-based 
paint, mold or asbestos, which cannot be completed with 
the tenant residing in the unit, requiring the tenant to vacate 
for 30 days or longer.130         Video Renewal Course: Real Estate Made Reel™Cosmetic improvements like painting or minor repairs that 
don’t require the tenant to vacate to ensure their safety are 
not considered substantial remodels. [CC §1946.2 (b)(2)(D)
(ii)]
In the notice to quit discussed above used in the context of 
an at-fault eviction — the tenant has materially breached 
the terms of a rental or lease agreement and the landlord is 
using the breach to terminate the lease or rental agreement. 
[See RPI Form 577-1]
Alternatively, a notice to vacate is used in the context of a no-
fault eviction to terminate a rental agreement and interfere 
with the automatic renewal of the periodic tenancy when a 
breach of the rental agreement has not occurred or is not 
an issue. [See RPI Form 569-2]
Relocation assistance
When a no-fault just cause eviction occurs for a non-exempt 
property, the landlord is required to provide relocation 
assistance to the tenant. Relocation assistance is equal to 
one month’s rent and is to be made: 
• as a direct payment within 15 calendar days of the 
notice to vacate; or
• in exchange for the landlord’s waiver of the payment 
of rent for the final month before it becomes due. [CC 
1946.2(d)(1); see RPI Form 569-2 §7]
Further, the landlord needs to notify the tenant of their right 
to relocation assistance in writing. This notice is provided 
within the body of the specialized 60-Day Notice to Vacate 
required for tenants who have resided in the property for 12 
months or longer.  [CC §1946.2(d)(2); see RPI Form 569-2 §7]Other rules for terminating a tenancy           131If the landlord fails to provide relocation assistance, the 
notice to vacate is void. [CC §1946.2(d)(4)]
Further, if the tenant receives the relocation assistance and 
then fails to vacate at the end of the notice period, the 
landlord is able to recover the relocation assistance as part 
of the damages in their action to retake possession. [CC 
§1946.2(d)(3)(B)]
If it was through the actions of the tenant that the property 
was rendered unfit for habitation, the tenant is not entitled 
to relocation assistance. [CC §1946.2(b)(2)(C)(iii)]
Tenants may not waive their rights provided to them under the 
just cause eviction laws. Any waiver made in the agreement 
is void as contrary to public policy.132         Video Renewal Course: Real Estate Made Reel™1. Though a landlord and tenant can establish a shorter or lengthier 
notice period by agreement, the notice period cannot be less 
than:

Tenant Leasehold Improvements
Ownership rights when a tenant vacates
Tenant improvements are improvements made to a leased property 
to meet the needs of the occupying tenant. 
Consider a retail business owner who enters into a commercial lease 
agreement to occupy commercial space as a tenant. The leased 
premises do not contain tenant improvements (TIs)  since the building 
is nothing more than a shell. [See RPI Form 552 through 552-4]
The tenant agrees to make all the tenant improvements needed to 
occupy the premises and operate a retail business (i.e., interior walls, 
flooring, ceilings, air conditioning, electrical outlets and lighting, 
plumbing, sprinklers, telephone and electronic wiring, etc.). 
The lease agreement provides for the property to be delivered to 
the landlord on expiration of the lease “in the condition the tenant 
received it,” less normal wear and tear. However, no lease provision 
addresses whether, on expiration of the lease, the TIs will remain with 
the property or the property is to be restored by the tenant to its original 
condition before the addition of the tenant improvements.  134         Video Renewal Course: Real Estate Made Reel™On expiration of the lease, the tenant strips the premises of all of the 
tenant improvements they placed on the property and vacates. The 
building is returned to the landlord in the condition it was found by 
the tenant: an empty shell, less wear and tear.  To relet the space, 
the landlord replaces nearly all the tenant improvements that were 
removed. 
Is the tenant liable for the landlord’s costs to replace the tenant 
improvements removed by the tenant on vacating?  
Yes! Improvements made by a tenant that are permanently affixed to 
real estate become part of the real estate to which they are attached. 
Improvements remain with the property on expiration of the tenancy, 
unless the lease agreement provides for the tenant to remove the 
improvements and restore the property to its original condition. [Calif. 
Civil Code §1013]
However, the landlord’s right to improvements added to the property 
and paid for by the tenant depends upon whether:
• the tenant improvements are permanent (built-in) or temporary  
(free-standing); and   
• the lease agreement requires the tenant to remove improvements 
and restore the premises.
All improvements attached to the building become part of the real 
estate, except for trade fixtures as discussed in a later section. [CC 
§660]
Examples of improvements that become part of the real estate 
include:   
• built-ins  (i.e., central air conditioning and heating, cabinets and 
stairwells); 
• fixtures  (i.e., electrical and plumbing);
• walls, doors and dropped ceilings ; and
• attached flooring (i.e., carpeting, tile or linoleum). 
In most circumstances, improvements attached to the building Ownership rights when a tenant vacates          135become part of the real estate. However, there are critical exceptions.  
Improvements that are unique to the operation of the tenant’s business 
are called trade fixtures . Trade fixtures are retained by the tenant on 
expiration of the lease. They are also known as trade improvements. 
1. Improvements made to a leased property to meet the needs of 
the occupying tenant are referred to as:
a. upgrades. 
b. trade improvements. 
c. trade secrets.
2. In most circumstances, improvements attached to the building:
a. become part of the real estate, except for fixtures.
b. become part of the real estate, except for trade fixtures.
c. do not become part of the real estate and are to be taken by 
the tenant when they vacate. 
3. Which of the following improvements would not become part of 
the real estate on expiration of a lease?    
a. central air conditioning and heating, cabinets and stairwells.
b. hair washing stations, mirrors and salon chairs.
c. walls, doors and dropped ceilings.136         Video Renewal Course: Real Estate Made Reel™
Leasehold improvement provisions and promises
Commercial lease agreements typically contain a  further-
improvements provision allowing the landlord to either:  
• retain tenant improvements and alterations made by the tenant; 
or  
• require restoration of the property to its original condition on 
expiration of the lease. [See RPI Form 552]  
Further-improvement provisions  usually include clauses stating:  
• who will make the construction of improvements (landlord or 
tenant);  
• who will pay for the construction of the improvements (landlord 
or tenant);  
• the landlord’s consent is required before the tenant makes 
improvements;  
• any mechanic’s liens due to improvements contracted by the 
tenant will be removed by the tenant; 
• the condition of the premises on expiration of the lease; and 
• whether and on what conditions the improvements are to remain 
or be removed on expiration of the lease. Ownership rights when a tenant vacates          137Improvements promised
A landlord under a lease agreement who agrees to make improvements 
to the rented premises is required to complete the improvements in a 
timely manner. If the landlord fails to make timely improvements, the 
tenant may cancel the lease agreement. [ See RPI Form 552 §10]  
Conversely, lease agreement provisions can obligate a tenant to 
construct or install improvements on the property. The time period for 
commencement and completion is agreed to in the lease agreement. 
If not agreed to, a reasonable period of time is allowed. [Calif. Civil 
Code §1657]
Further-improvement provisions typically call for the landlord to approve 
the planned improvements before construction is commenced.  
Alternatively, some lease agreement provisions allow a tenant to 
make necessary improvements without the landlord’s further consent. 
These improvements are not specifically mandated, or required to be 
completed in exchange for a reduction in rent. This non-mandatory 
type of improvement is called a permissive improvement .
For example, a landlord and tenant sign a long-term lease agreement. 
Its further-improvements provision authorizes the tenant to demolish 
an existing building located on the property and construct a new one 
in its place without first obtaining the landlord’s consent. The rent is 
based solely on the current value of the premises.  
The further-improvements provision does not state a specific time 
period for demolition or construction.  
The tenant makes no effort to tear down the old building or erect 
a new one. Ultimately, the landlord claims the tenant has breached 
the lease agreement for failing to demolish the existing building and 
construct a new one.  
Here, the tenant has not breached the lease agreement. The 
agreement contained no promise by the tenant to build and the 
rental amount was not based on the construction. The tenant was 
authorized to build without need for the landlord’s approval, but was 138         Video Renewal Course: Real Estate Made Reel™not obligated to do so. Thus, the improvements on the tenant’s part 
were permissive, not mandatory. [Kusmark v. Montgomery Ward and 
Co. (1967) 249 CA2d 585]
 Mandatory improvements
A further-improvements provision that requires a tenant to 
construct improvements at a rent rate reflecting the value of 
the land, has different consequences. 
If a date is not specified for completion of the improvements, 
the tenant needs to complete construction within a 
reasonable period of time since construction of improvements 
is mandated to occur.  
For example, a landlord leases unimproved land to a 
developer who is obligated to build improvements, contingent 
on obtaining a construction mortgage. A time period is not 
set for commencement or completion of the construction. 
However, a cancellation provision gives the tenant/
developer the right to cancel the lease agreement within 
one year if financing is not found to fund the construction. 
No provision authorizes the landlord to terminate the lease if 
the required construction is not completed.  
Due to the onset of a recession, the tenant is unable to 
arrange financing within the one-year period. However, they 
do not exercise their right to cancel the lease agreement 
and avoid payment of future rents. Instead, the tenant 
continues their good faith effort to locate and qualify for 
construction financing. Ultimately, financing is not located 
and construction is not commenced.  
A few years later, as the economy is showing signs of recovery, 
the landlord terminates the lease. The landlord claims the Leasehold improvement provisions and promises           139lease agreement has been breached since the promised 
construction was not completed.  
The tenant claims the landlord cannot terminate the lease as 
long as the tenant continues their good faith effort to locate 
financing and remains solvent to qualify for the financing.  
Here, the tenant has breached the lease agreement. 
They failed to construct the intended improvements within 
a reasonable period of time. The original purpose of the 
lease was to have buildings erected without specifying a 
completion date. Following the expiration of the right to 
cancel, the landlord gave the tenant a reasonable amount of 
time in which to commence construction before terminating 
the lease.  
When the original purpose for the lease was the construction 
of a building by the tenant, a landlord cannot be forced to 
forgo the improvements bargained for. [City of Stockton v. 
Stockton Plaza Corporation (1968) 261 CA2d 639]
Surrender of improvements  
All tenant improvements are to remain with the leased property on 
termination of a lease unless the lease agreement permits or mandates 
their removal by the tenant as a restoration of the premises.  
Most lease agreements merely provide for the property to be returned 
in good condition, minus ordinary wear and tear for the years of the 
tenant’s occupancy. Thus, the tenant is not required to restore the 
property to its actual condition when they took possession since tenant 
improvements are part of the real estate. 
A provision calling for the tenant’s ordinary care of the premises does 
not also require the tenant to remove their improvements or renovate 
the premises to eliminate deterioration, obsolescence or normal 140         Video Renewal Course: Real Estate Made Reel™wear and tear caused by the tenant’s permitted use of the property . 
[Kanner v. Globe Bottling Co. (1969) 273 CA2d 559 ]
If a lease does not require the tenant to restore the property to the 
condition it was in when received, the tenant may only remove their 
personal improvements, called trade improvements or trade fixtures .Leasehold improvement provisions and promises           1411. What is the lease provision which controls whether a landlord is

a. Reversion and retention provision. 
b. Mandatory-improvements provision.
c. Further-improvements provision.

c. in any condition, minus defects which render the property 
uninhabitable for future tenants.142         Video Renewal Course: Real Estate Made Reel™
Real estate fixtures vs. trade fixtures
Two types of fixtures exist distinguishing improvements installed in a 
building:  
•	real estate fixtures ; and  
•	trade fixtures .  
A real estate fixture is personal property that is attached to the real 
estate. It becomes part of the real estate it is attached to and is 
conveyed with the property. [Calif. Civil Code §§660; 1013]
For example, if a tenant rents an office and builds bookshelves into the 
wall rather than merely anchoring them to the wall, the bookshelves 
become part of the improvements located on the real estate.  
When the lease expires, real estate fixtures become the landlord’s 
property. The landlord takes possession of the real estate fixtures as 
part of the real estate forfeited or surrendered to the landlord, unless 
the lease agreement provides for restoration or permits removal by the 
tenant. The conveyance of real estate fixtures from tenant to landlord 
on expiration of the lease is called reversion. [City of Beverly Hills v. 
Albright (1960) 184 CA2d 562]Real estate fixtures vs. trade fixtures          143Conversely, trade fixtures do not revert to the landlord on expiration 
of the lease. A trade fixture is an improvement that is attached to 
the real estate by the tenant and is unique to the operation of the 
tenant’s business, not the use of the building.  
Consider a tenant who leases property to operate a beauty salon. 
The tenant moves in work-related furnishings (i.e., mirrors, salon chairs, 
wash stations and dryers), necessary to run the business. The items are 
attached to the floor, walls, plumbing and electrical leads.  
On expiration of the lease, the tenant removes the fixtures that were 
used to render the services offered by the business. The landlord 
claims the fixtures are improvements to the property and cannot be 
removed since they became part of the real estate when installed.  
However, furnishings unique to the operation of a business are 
considered trade fixtures even though the furnishings are attached 
and built into the structure. Trade fixtures are removable by the tenant.  
A tenant may, at the end of or anytime during the lease term, remove 
any fixture used for trade purposes if the removal can be done without 
damaging the premises. [ Beebe v. Richards (1953) 115 CA2d 589]
144         Video Renewal Course: Real Estate Made Reel™Fixtures that have become an integral part of the building’s structure 
due to the way they are attached or the general purpose they serve 
cannot be removed. Examples of fixtures which cannot be removed 
include toilets, air conditioners, vent conduits, sprinkler systems and 
lowered ceilings. [CC §1019]
Reimbursement for tenant improvements on 
wrongful eviction
What compensation may be due to a tenant who has 
improved the property and is wrongfully evicted prior to 
expiration of a lease?  
A tenant who is wrongfully evicted is entitled to the rental value 
of their improvements for the remainder of their unexpired 
lease term. Without reimbursement, the landlord receives a 
windfall profit for their use of the tenant’s improvements until 
they revert to the landlord on expiration of the original lease.  
The tenant is not, however, entitled to reimbursement for the 
market value or cost of the improvements. 
Thus, a wrongfully evicted tenant is limited to collecting the 
reasonable value for the landlord’s use of the improvements 
during the remainder of the term on the original lease. [Asell 
v. Rodrigues (1973) 32 CA3d 817]
Trade fixtures as security  
Lease agreements often contain a default provision prohibiting 
the tenant from removing the trade fixtures when the agreement is 
breached. The tenant (and their unsecured creditors) no longer has a 
right to the trade fixtures under a default provision.  
Consider a tenant who signs a commercial lease agreement to use the Real estate fixtures vs. trade fixtures          145premises to operate a frozen packaging plant. The lease agreement 
states all fixtures, trade or leasehold, belong to the landlord if the lease 
is terminated due to a breach by the tenant.  
The tenant later encumbers the existing trade fixtures by borrowing 
money against them. The tenant then defaults on their lease payments. 
While in default on the lease, the tenant surrenders the property to the 
landlord, including all trade fixtures.  
Does the lender on the mortgage secured by the trade fixtures have 
a right to repossess them?  
No! The tenant lost their ownership right to remove the trade fixtures 
under the terms of the lease agreement that was entered into before 
they encumbered the trade fixtures. Any right to the fixtures held by 
the secured lender is similarly lost since the lender is junior in time and 
thus subordinate to the landlord’s interest in the fixtures under the 
lease agreement.  
However, if the trade fixtures installed by the tenant are owned by a 
third party, or if a third party had a lien on them at the time of their 
installation, the landlord has no more right to them than the tenant.

Notice of Nonresponsibility protects against a mechanic’s 
lien
Tenants occasionally contract for improvements to be constructed on 
the premises they have leased. Any mechanic’s lien by a contractor 
for nonpayment initially attaches to the tenant’s leasehold interest in 
the property. [Calif. Civil Code §8442(a)]
However, the mechanic’s lien for unpaid labor and materials may also 
attach to the fee simple interest held by the landlord if the landlord or 
the landlord’s property manager:  
• acquires knowledge the construction is taking place; and  
• fails to post and record a Notice of Nonresponsibility . [See RPI 
Form 597]  
A Notice of Nonresponsibility  is a written notice which needs to be:  
• posted in a conspicuous place on the premises within ten days 
after the landlord or their property manager first has knowledge 
of the construction; and  
• recorded with the county recorder’s office within the same ten-

lien to collect for unpaid labor and materials delivered to improve 
the property under contract with the tenant. [Peterson v. Freiermuth 
(1911) 17 CA 609]
Nonresponsibility on mandatory improvements
Further, if the lease requires the tenant to make mandatory 
improvements,  a mechanic’s lien attaches to the landlord’s interest 
even when the landlord has posted and recorded a Notice of 
Nonresponsibility.
For example, a lease states the tenant is to make certain improvements 
as a condition of renting the property. Since the improvements are 
mandatory improvements rather than permissive improvements, the 
tenant is deemed to be the landlord’s agent. The tenant is contracting 
for the construction of the mandated improvements on behalf of the 
landlord.
Thus, the mechanic’s lien incurred by the tenant will attach to both 
the tenant’s and the landlord’s interest in the property, despite any 
posted and recorded Notice of Nonresponsibility. [Los Banos Gravel 
Company v. Freeman (1976) 58 CA3d 785]
Had the lease merely authorized the tenant to make nonmandatory 
(permissive) improvements, the tenant will not be acting as an agent 
for the landlord. In that case, the landlord’s interest in the property is 
not subjected to a mechanic’s lien if the Notice of Nonresponsibility is 
timely posted and recorded on discovery of the tenant improvements. 
[Baker v. Hubbard (1980) 101 CA3d 226]150         Video Renewal Course: Real Estate Made Reel™Removal of fixtures by contractor
A mechanic’s lien cannot be recorded against the landlord if 
the improvements are removed by the contractor recording 
the lien.  
For example, a tenant contracts to have air conditioning 
installed in the building the tenant rents. The contractor 
sells the equipment to the tenant under a conditional sales 
contract. The contractor retains title to the equipment as 
security until the sales contract debt is paid.  
The landlord’s consent to the improvements is not obtained 
by the tenant, but the landlord has knowledge the work 
has commenced. The landlord does not post a Notice of 
Nonresponsibility.  
Later, after the air conditioning units are installed, the tenant 
vacates the property.  
The contractor is not paid and files a mechanic’s lien against 
the landlord’s fee interest in the property. Further, the 
contractor repossesses the air conditioning units and resells 
them at a loss. The contractor then seeks to recover their 
losses under the mechanic’s lien.  
However, by electing to repossess the units, the contractor 
waived their right to pursue the mechanic’s lien to foreclosure.  
Whether the air conditioning units are considered a removable 
fixture due to the financing, or a property improvement 
permitting the recording of a mechanic’s lien, is no longer 
an issue after their removal. The contractor  removed the 
units and chose to treat the units as personal property. Thus, 
the contractor lost their lien rights for nonpayment. [Cornell 
v. Sennes (1971) 18 CA3d 126]Notice of nonresponsibility protects against a mechanic’s lien           151Failure to perfect a lien
Consider the tenant who leases a property containing tanks for 
holding gasoline. The tenant negotiates a reduced rental payment in 
exchange for installing fuel pumps free of any liens.  
The tenant purchases the pumps on credit and the pumps are installed. 
The supplier of the pumps does not receive a Uniform Commercial Code 
(UCC-1)  financing statement from the tenant. Thus, the supplier does 
not file a UCC-1 with the Secretary of State, a requisite to perfecting 
the supplier’s lien on the pumps.  [See RPI Form 436-1]
Later, the pump supplier claims title to the pumps due to the unpaid 
installation debt and seeks to repossess them.  
However, the landlord owns the pumps as fixtures which became 
part of the real estate. The landlord gave consideration in the form 
of reduced rent to acquire the pumps. More importantly, the pump 
supplier failed to perfect its lien on installation of the pumps. [Southland

On entering into a listing agreement , the broker and their agents 
are retained and authorized to diligently perform real estate related 
services on behalf of the client in exchange for payment of a fee.

Right to a fee
The agent of a broker has a right to a fee on transactions based on the 
agent’s written employment agreement with the broker, not under the 
separate listing agreement the broker has with the client. Through the 
broker-agent employment agreement, the agent is entitled to share 
in the fees actually received by the broker on transactions in which 
the agent participates. [ See RPI Forms 505 and 506 ]  
A licensed agent representing a broker acts as an agent of the broker . 
As the broker’s agent, the agent performs on behalf of the broker (as 
well as the client) all the activities the broker has been retained by the 
client to provide. Further, an agent providing real estate related services 
on behalf of a client may not do so independently of their broker. 
Thus, an agent employed by a broker is referred to as “the agent of 
the (client’s) agent,” acting as an

Employed to act as an agent
The relationship created between the client and the broker by a listing 
agreement  has two distinct legal aspects:  
• an employment relationship; and  
• an agency relationship.
The employment relationship established on entering into a listing 
agreement specifies the scope of activities  the broker and the broker’s 
agents are to undertake in the employment and authorizes the broker 
to carry them out.  
On the other hand, the agency relationship is imposed on the broker by 
law as arising out of the representation authorized by the employment. 
Agency carries with it the fiduciary duty of loyalty and full disclosure 
owed by the broker (and their sales agents) to the client. [See RPI 
Form 305] 
As a fiduciary, the broker’s and agents’ conduct under the employment 
are equated to the conduct required of a trustee acting on behalf 
of a beneficiary. This fiduciary duty, also called agency, precedes 
commencement and survives the termination of the employment 
relationship. [Calif. Civil Code §2079.16]160         Video Renewal Course: Real Estate Made Reel™Also, an oral agreement to perform brokerage services on behalf of a 
client imposes an agency law obligation on the broker and agents to 
act as fiduciaries — no differently than had a writing existed. However, 
the client’s oral promise to pay a fee does not entitle the broker to 
enforce collection of the fee due from the client – buyer or seller – 
when working for a client without a written listing agreement.
An agreement employing a broker to purchase or sell real estate, 
lease a property for over one year or arrange mortgage financing is 
controlled by contract law. For a broker to enforce a promise from a

• in writing; and 
• signed by the client. [CC §1624(a)(4)]Employed to act as an agent           1611. The relationship created between the client and the broker by a

Types of Listing Agreements 
A variety of listing agreements exist, each employing and authorizing 
a broker to perform real estate related services under different 
conditions. 
The variations usually relate to: 
• the extent of the broker’s representation; 
• the type of services to be performed by the broker and their 
agents; and
• the events which trigger payment of a fee. [See RPI Forms 102-
104 and 110-112]
The purpose for most listing agreements is the sale or purchase of single-
family residential (SFR) property. Others are for residential-income and 
commercial-income properties comprising industrial, retail, office, 
farm and motel/hotel or unimproved parcels.
Despite the application of various agreements to the type of property 
described in the listing, all listings fall into one of two general categories:

Exclusive listings 
Under an exclusive listing, a broker receives the sole right to represent:  
• an owner by marketing a listed property for sale or lease and 
locating a qualified buyer or tenant [See RPI Forms 102  and 102-
1]; 
• a buyer or tenant by locating property [See RPI Forms 103 and 
103-1 ]; or
• an owner or lender to mortgage a property.
An exclusive listing requires an agent to use diligence in their efforts to 
fulfill the client’s objectives to locate a buyer, tenant or lender for the 
property. An exclusive listing has a specified period of employment 
set by a mandated expiration date of the employment, such as 90 or 
180 days after its commencement. 
If the broker fails to include an expiration date in an exclusive listing, 
they face disciplinary action by the Department of Real Estate (DRE) 
on a complaint. [Calif. Business and Professions Code §10176(f)]
Two types of exclusive employment agreements for buying and selling 
real estate exist:  
• an exclusive agency listing for a seller or buyer; and  Exclusive listings       165• an exclusive right-to-sell or right-to-buy listing agreement. [See 
RPI Forms 102-104]  
Both types of exclusive listings establish the broker and their agents as 
the sole licensed real estate representatives of the client. However, 
these variations are distinguished by whether or not the broker is 
entitled to a fee when the property is sold or located solely by the 
efforts of the client.  
Under an exclusive agency listing fee provision, the broker does not 
earn a fee when the client, acting alone and independently of any 
other broker or the seller’s broker, accomplishes the objective of the 
employment, i.e., selling the listed property or locating and buying the 
property sought.  
Conversely, under the fee provision in an exclusive right-to-sell/buy 
agreement , the broker earns a fee no matter who produces the buyer 
or locates the property sought under the listing during the listing period. 
This is the case whether it is the client, the seller’s broker or another 
broker or representative of the client who produces a buyer or locates 
a property. [Calif. Civil Code §1086(f)(1)]
An exclusive employment is an 
example of a bilateral contract.  The 
broker or agent agree to exercise 
due diligence to fulfill the client’s real 
estate objectives. In exchange, the 
client, be they the buyer or seller, 
promises to pay a fee under various 
circumstances.
In the context of a contract, it means 
both parties are bound to act. Stated 
another way, it’s a promise for a 
promise. LISTING AGREEMENT166         Video Renewal Course: Real Estate Made Reel™1. If a broker fails to include an expiration date in an exclusive listing:

Exclusive right-to-sell listings: a closer look 
An exclusive right-to-sell listing agreement affords a real estate broker 
the greatest fee protection for their efforts. It is also the most commonly 
used type of listing. [ See RPI Form 102]
This listing employs the broker as the sole agent to act on behalf of the 
owner to market the property and negotiate any sale with all potential 
buyers and their agents. The broker is entitled to a fee regardless of 
who procures the buyer. [ See RPI Form 102]
Under an exclusive right-to-sell agreement , the owner relinquishes their 
right to list the property with other brokers or defeat the seller’s broker’s 
entitlement to compensation by selling the property themselves, as 
occurs under an exclusive agency listing or open listing.  
An owner of real estate, on entering into an exclusive right-to-sell 
listing agreement, grants a broker the right to locate a buyer for the 
property prior to the expiration of the period of employment specified 
in the listing agreement. 
The broker is entitled to the fee agreed to in the listing if, during the 
listing period:  
• the property is sold on any terms, no matter who produces the Exclusive right-to-sell listings: a closer look            168

• the broker or their agent presents the seller with a bona-fide offer 
from a ready, willing and able buyer on terms sought by the seller 
under the listing, or on other terms accepted by the seller. [Calif. 
Civil Code §1086(f)(1)]
Exclusive right-to-sell listing agreements  give a broker and their agents 
the greatest incentive to fulfill their fiduciary duty and work toward 
attaining the client’s goal of locating a buyer who acquires the 
property. Here, the seller’s broker does not compete with the client to 
sell the property — they work together to achieve the sale. [See RPI 
Form 102]
Buyer’s brokers know that sellers who enter into exclusive right-to-sell 
listing agreements are fully committed to working with brokers. Also, 
sellers who retain competent agents are counseled on prices of 
comparable properties and current market conditions. Thus, the seller 
of a listed property is more likely to accept a reasonable offer. 
In turn, buyer’s brokers are comfortable exposing their clients to 
properties listed exclusively by other brokers.  
Termination of agency by the seller
Consider a seller of real estate who enters into an exclusive listing 
agreement with a broker to sell a property within, say, a three-month 
period. The fee provision in the listing contains a termination-of-agency  
clause addressing seller interference with the employment.  It entitles 
the broker to a full fee if the seller terminates the broker’s employment, 
without good cause, prior to expiration of the listing period. [See RPI 
Form 102 §3.1(c)] 
The broker’s agent, as agreed in the listing, promptly commences a 
diligent marketing effort:
• to properly present the property for sale; and 
• to locate a buyer who is willing to acquire the property. 
However, during the listing period before a buyer is located, the seller 
terminates the agency by acting to cancel the listing. 170         Video Renewal Course: Real Estate Made Reel™The broker makes a demand on the seller for a full listing fee, claiming 
the termination-of-agency clause in the fee provision of the listing 
calls for payment of a fee as earned when the seller prematurely 
terminates the agency. The seller claims the broker is not entitled to 
a full broker fee, but only to money losses based on an accounting 
for their time, effort and costs incurred to market the property, called 
quantum meruit  – the amount deserved for work completed – since 
a seller has the right to terminate a broker’s agency at any time.   
 
Is the broker entitled to collect a full fee from the seller upon the seller’s 
exercise of their right to terminate the agency at any time?
Yes! It is correct that a seller may terminate the broker’s agency at any 
time. However, the seller cannot both terminate the agency during 
the listing period and avoid payment of a fee when a termination-of-
agency clause exists in the listing agreement the seller entered. The 
termination-of-agency clause in the listing agreement couples the 
permissible cancelling of the listing with the obligation to pay a fee.
Documenting the cancellation
When a seller, by word or by conduct, clearly indicates 
they no longer desire to sell the property or use the services 
of the broker/agent, the agent prepares a Release and 
Cancellation of Employment Agreement  form for the seller to 
review and sign. [See Form 121 accompanying this chapter]
The release and cancellation  agreement as prepared will 
initially call for immediate payment of the full broker fee 
agreed to in the listing in exchange for agreeing to a mutual 
cancellation of the listing agreement.
To garner agreement, it might be altered to call for payment 
at a later date when the property is sold, placed again on 
the market, exchanged, optioned, refinanced (if the broker Exclusive right-to-sell listings: a closer look            171was retained to arrange new financing) or leased to anyone 
within a specified time period (for example, one year) after 
the date of the release agreement. A compromise might be 
the payment of a partial fee with the balance due if the 
property is sold within a stated time period after cancellation.
This release and cancellation agreement is also used when 
a buyer wants to cancel an exclusive right-to-buy listing. On 
cancellation, the broker is deprived of the opportunity they 
acquired under the listing and relied on to diligently earn a 
contingency fee.172         Video Renewal Course: Real Estate Made Reel™1. An __________ affords a real estate broker the greatest fee

Exclusive right-to-buy listings 
For brokers and their agents, an exclusive right-to-buy listing agreement 
creates a contrasting but parallel activity from listing and marketing 
property for sale. [ See RPI Form 103]
Under a buyer’s listing, a prospective buyer employs a broker to locate 
qualified properties of the type the buyer seeks to purchase.  
As with an exclusive right-to-sell listing, the right-to-buy variation has 
provisions for a broker fee to be paid by the buyer — if not paid by the 
seller — when the buyer acquires property during the listing period of 
the type described in the buyer’s listing.  
Also, the exclusive right-to-buy listing provides greater incentive for 
brokers and their agents. The exclusive aspect and the due diligence 
provision imposes a duty to work diligently and continuously to meet 
their buyers’ objectives.
The buyer benefits under an exclusive right-to-buy listing due to the 
greater likelihood the broker will find the particular type of property 
sought. Brokers also act as a safeguard for the buyer since they:
• have continuous access to all available properties;
• investigate and qualify properties as suitable before they are 174         Video Renewal Course: Real Estate Made Reel™

Importantly, a buyer’s broker locating properties listed by other brokers 
does not become a dual agent or lose their status as the buyer’s 
exclusive agent merely because the buyer’s broker works with seller’s 
brokers to obtain information on the listed properties. 
Also, the buyer’s broker’s fee is typically paid by the seller — either 
directly or through the seller’s broker — a fee activity which does not 
create a dual agency. As always, all compensation received by a 
broker and their agents arising out of a transaction involving their 
client is fully disclosed to the client. 
A broker who seeks out and locates properties at their buyer’s request 
does so and negotiates the purchase terms as the buyer’s agent 
regardless of who pays the fee. Again, the fee is typically paid by the 
seller from the proceeds of the sales price paid by the buyer.
Alternatively, the buyer’s broker fee is paid by the buyer as part of 
their purchase price. Here, the seller receives the remainder as their 
gross proceeds from the sale, and is responsible for any fees the seller’s 
broker is to receive.
Fee agreement to buy a specific property – the 
buyer assures payment
When acting as a buyer’s agent, a large portion of the 
agent’s time is spent assisting their buyer to locate qualifying 
properties. However, an agent is generally not involved in 
this initial step of locating a property when:
• they represent a buyer at a real estate auction;
• the buyer has already located a property to purchase 
independent of the agent; or176         Video Renewal Course: Real Estate Made Reel™

property of interest and no written employment 
agreement assuring a fee exists. [See RPI Form 103]
When a specific property has been selected by the buyer, 
the agent needs to enter into a written single property fee 
agreement with their buyer. The agreement safeguards 
the agent’s time spent on behalf of the buyer by assuring 
collection of a fee if the buyer acquires the property. [See 
RPI Form 103-1]
The single property fee agreement is essentially a buyer’s 
retainer agreement of the contingency fee variety, in contrast 
to an advance fee arrangement, setting the fee amount to 
be paid by the seller, and not by the buyer, contingent on 
the buyer acquiring the property.
Without the need to locate a suitable property, the single 
property fee agreement lists the specific tasks the buyer’s 
agent is to do to receive a fee, such as:
• evaluating the economic suitability of the transaction;
• attending an open house with the buyer prior to auction 
and inspecting the property;
• obtaining and analyzing a title profile on the property;
• examining pest control reports;
• obtaining plat maps of the area surrounding the 
property;
• checking the property’s proximity to schools, markets, 
financial institutions, etc.; and
• developing an opinion of the property’s fair market 
value (FMV). [See RPI Form 103-1 §3.1]
If the buyer is already aware of a suitable property, or has 
located a suitable property prior to or after working with 
the agent, the agent is to enter into a single property fee Exclusive right-to-buy listings          178agreement with the buyer as soon as possible. With the 
writing in hand, the buyer’s agent then holds an enforceable 
fee arrangement with the buyer, whether it is the seller or the 
buyer who is to pay the fee.
Once a suitable property has been selected for purchase, 
the agent is not to enter into a listing agreement with the 
seller to establish an enforceable right to collect a fee. Doing 
so with the seller unnecessarily creates a dual agency  under 
circumstances not understood by many agents, and thus 
the dual agency goes undisclosed.
If the buyer’s agent enter into a listing agreement with the 
seller, they will this be representing both the buyer and the 
seller, taking on an agency duty to each of the opposing 
parties in the transaction. This dual agency relationship needs 
to be disclosed and consented to by both clients.
When an agent has been working with a buyer to locate 
property and the buyer decides to acquire a specific property, 
the agent’s prior conduct with that buyer has established a 
client relationship with them. Thus, it is the buyer who needs 
to sign a single property fee agreement. The writing formally 
employs the agent as the buyer’s representation and 
assures payment of a fee if the buyer acquires the property, 
whether it is the buyer or the seller who is to pay the fee. 
[L. Byron Culver & Associates v. Jaoudi Industrial & Trading 
Corporation (1991) 1 CA4th 300]
After the buyer signs the single property fee agreement 
granting the agent the right to collect a fee, the agent can 
then prepare a purchase offer for signing and delivery to the 
seller. The terms of the purchase offer signed by the buyer 
include a fee provision calling for the buyer’s agent’s fee 
to be paid by the seller as part of the buyer’s agreement to 
purchase the property. [See RPI Form 159 §16]Exclusive right-to-buy listings          179In the instance of a real estate auction, a buyer’s agent has 
absolutely no assurance their buyer will be the highest bidder. 
Thus, under a regular buyer’s listing agreement calling for a 
fee to be paid on the buyer’s acquisition of the property, the 
agent runs the very real risk of receiving no compensation 
for their time, effort and talent conducting due diligence 
investigations and assisting in the bidding – the epitome of 
sunk costs.
Sunk costs are not recoverable under any present or future 
condition and are lost forever.
When the buyer does acquire the property as the highest 
bidder, the single property fee arrangement is structured as 
a percentage of the price paid, such as 3%, or a fixed dollar 
amount, to be paid by the buyer. [See RPI Form 103-1 §5.1]
However, the buyer’s agent needs to be paid under some 
formula for handling auction situations when the buyer does 
not win the bidding contest. 
When the buyer does not acquire the property, the fee under 
the single property agreement calls for compensation based 
on an hourly wage, such as a dollar amount per hour, for 
the agent’s time spent investigating and assisting the buyer 
prior to completion of the auction. Alternatively, the buyer’s 
agent can arrange to be paid a flat lump-sum fee for your 
services rendered. [See RPI Form 103-1 §5.3(a), (b)]180         Video Renewal Course: Real Estate Made Reel™1. Under an exclusive right-to-buy listing agreement, the fee itself is 
frequently:
a. paid by the seller from the proceeds of the sales price paid by 
the buyer.
b. paid directly by the buyer from fund reserved for this purpose. 
c. bundled into an impound account to be paid to the buyer’s 
broker incrementally after closing. 
2. Compared to a buyer who does not have their own representation, 
a buyer under an exclusive right-to-buy listing:
a. has the advantage of obtaining the full duty of loyalty from the 
seller’s agent at no further cost.  
b. benefits by experiencing a much greater likelihood the buyer’s 
broker or their agents will find the particular type of property 
sought. 
c. frequently pays greater transactional costs despite not having 
access to the multiple listing service (MLS).

a. automatically becomes a dual agent. 
b. does not become a dual agent.
c. is in breach of their fiduciary duties owed to their client. Introduction to open listings           181
Introduction to open listings
An open listing, sometimes called a nonexclusive listing, allows the 
owner to market the property themselves while employing brokers to 
locate buyers and sell the property. The client may enter into open 
listings with as many brokers as they want to without becoming 
obligated to pay more than one fee, if any. 
Thus, the owner under an open listing competes against the seller’s 
brokers to locate buyers. If the owner does locate a buyer, the owner 
does not become obligated to pay a fee under any open listing. 
In contrast to other types of listings, an open listing does not grant 
exclusive rights to the seller’s broker and their agents to be the sole 
representative of the client. This is true whether the client is a buyer, 
tenant, borrower, seller, landlord or lender. 
A broker fee under an open listing to sell real estate is due a broker only 
if the broker or agent procures a ready, willing and able buyer and 
presents the owner with an offer from the buyer to purchase the listed 
property. The terms contained in the offer submitted by the broker are 
substantially the same as the terms sought by the owner under the 
listing to earn a fee, whether or not the seller accepts it, called a full 
listing offer.  If other terms are offered by a buyer and accepted by 182         Video Renewal Course: Real Estate Made Reel™the owner, the broker earns their fee.  
For a broker to be entitled to a fee under an open listing, the broker or 
agent will present the offer to the owner before  the property is sold to 
some other buyer located by another broker or by the owner directly. 
Also, the offer will be submitted before the listing expires or is revoked 
by withdrawal of the property from sale or by the termination of the 
agency. [Calif. Civil Code §1086(f)(3)]Introduction to open listings           1831. A client may enter into open listings with as many brokers as they 
choose, but:
a. they are obligated to pay a fee to all brokers who submit a 
reasonable offer prior to expiration of the listing. 
b. they need to delegate a managing broker through which all 
other brokers are to coordinate. 
c. they are not obligated to pay more than one fee to the broker 
who procures a buyer who presents an offer on the terms sought 
in the listing.
2. A seller under an open listing: 
a. has granted exclusive rights to the seller’s broker and their 
agents to be their sole representative.
b. works in tandem the seller’s brokers to help them locate buyers. 
c. effectively competes against the seller’s brokers to locate 
buyers.
3. An offer submitted by a broker to a seller with substantially the same 
terms sought by the seller under the open listing is called a(n):
a. full listing offer.  
b. option to purchase. 
c. guaranteed offer. 184         Video Renewal Course: Real Estate Made Reel™
Open Listings: a Unilateral Contract 
The broker employed under an open listing is not obligated to use 
diligence in their efforts to locate a buyer. The broker only has a best-
effort obligation since the broker does not “accept” the employment 
until they produce a buyer for the property. 
Thus, an open listing is legally classified as a unilateral contract. 
However, the agency duties of a fiduciary exist at all times under an 
open listing,  Further, on locating a buyer the broker is to perform their 
due diligence efforts  to make disclosures and close the transaction.  
The first broker to submit an offer during this open listing period from a 
ready, willing and able buyer to purchase property on the listed terms, 
or on other terms accepted by the owner, has earned the agreed 
fee. No other broker holding open listings from the owner are entitled 
to a fee.  
A broker may also represent a buyer to locate property under an 
open listing agreement. A broker assisting a buyer to locate a suitable 
property among multiple listing service (MLS) listings held by other 
brokers at least considers asking the buyer to sign an open listing if 
the broker chooses not to solicit an exclusive representation with its 
imposition of due diligence duties.  Open Listings: a Unilateral Contract        185Further, an open listing does not need to contain an expiration date, 
unlike an exclusive agency or exclusive right-to-sell/buy listing which 
require inclusion of an expiration date.  
Cancellation of an open listing
The owner revoking an open listing that contains an expiration date 
owes a fee to the broker if: 
• the owner later closes a sale with a prospective buyer located 
by the broker before the listing is revoked; or 
• the owner revokes the listing in an attempt to escape payment 
of the agreed fee. [Heffernan v. Merrill Estate Co. (1946) 77 CA2d 
106]
Conversely, an open listing without an expiration date may be 
terminated by the owner at any time without becoming obligated to 
pay a fee. Also, no fee is due under an open listing on:
• the good-faith withdrawal of the property from the market; or 
• the premature termination of the employment before the broker 
has submitted a full listing offer . [Tetrick v. Sloan (1959) 170 CA2d 
540]
Fees for other services
An open listing may contain a provision calling for the owner 
to pay the seller’s broker a set amount, at an agreed time, 
for services other than procuring a buyer. These services may 
include the preparation of disclosure documents needed by 
the owner to sell the property, such as:  
• property disclosures (the Transfer Disclosure Statement 
(TDS), natural hazard disclosures (NHD), the Annual 
Property Operating Data sheet (APOD), etc.) [See RPI 
Forms 304, 314 and 352];  
186         Video Renewal Course: Real Estate Made Reel™• carryback financing disclosures [See RPI Form 300];  
• multiple listing service publications;  
• property profiles [See RPI Form 306];  
• termite/well/septic clearances; and  
• occupancy certificates. [Calif. Civil Code §1089]
Although the broker does not have a due diligence duty 
under an open listing, the seller’s broker owes a duty to 
prospective buyers they have contact with to make a full 
disclosure of the property’s condition, as known to the broker. 
The TDS disclosure, based on the broker’s visual inspection 
of the property, is to be made prior to the buyer and seller 
entering into a purchase agreement. Open Listings: a Unilateral Contract        1871. A broker employed under an open listing has a __________ to locate 
a buyer. 
a. due diligence obligation

Net Listings for Sellers
A net listing  is used only with sellers, not buyers. It is structured as either an 
open or an exclusive type of listing. The net listing is distinguishable from 
all other listing arrangements due to the way a broker’s compensation 
is calculated.  
In a net listing, the broker’s fee is not based on a percentage of the 
selling price.  
Instead, the seller’s net sales price (excluding broker fees and closing 
costs) to be received by the seller on closing is stated in the listing 
agreement. The broker’s fee equals whatever amount the buyer pays 
in excess of the seller’s net figure and closing costs.  
However, the broker discloses to the seller the full sales price paid by 
the buyer and the amount of the broker’s residual fee before the seller 
accepts an offer on a net listing. Failure to disclose to the client the 
benefits the broker receives on any transaction leads to loss of the 
entire fee. [Calif. Business and Professions Code §10176(g)]
For example, if the seller enters into a net listing agreement with a 
real estate broker for a net sales price of $500,000, the broker will not 
receive a fee if the seller accepts an offer selling the property for Net Listings for Sellers           189$500,000 or less.  
On the other hand, if the property sells for $575,000, the broker’s fee is 
$75,000, minus the seller’s other transaction costs.  
Net listings tend to be unpopular with the Department of Real Estate 
(DRE) and consumer protection organizations, and have been 
outlawed in some states, but not California.  
Net listings are particularly prone to claims from buyers and sellers 
that the broker has been involved in misrepresentations and unfair 
dealings. These claims are generally based on an improper valuation 
of the property at the time of the listing or a failure to disclose the fee 
received by the broker when the property sells.  
If the seller thinks the broker’s fee is excessive, the seller is likely to 
complain they were improperly advised about the property’s fair 
market value (FMV) when employing the broker.  
Thus, net listings are used sparingly, if at all. If a net listing is used, sale 
documentation is to include complete disclosures stating: 
• the property’s value; 
• the price paid by a buyer; and 
• the resulting fee amount.

c. does not receive a fee if the seller accepts an offer selling the

Option Listing Variation 
An option listing is a variation of the exclusive right-
to-sell listing.  
Its unique feature is the additional element of a grant 
to the broker of an option to buy the property at a 
predetermined price, if the property does not sell 
during the listing period.  
The broker wears two hats when holding an 
option listing: one as an agent, and the other as 
a principal.  
The concurrent status of agent and principal is a 
conflict of interest  for the broker. Here, the temptation 
for misrepresentation  is apparent. 
As a result, the seller’s broker may fail to market the 
property aggressively, with a view toward buying it 
themselves, then reselling it at a profit. Likewise, the 
broker may neglect to inform the seller about all inquiries 
into the listed property by potential buyers.  
As always, brokers are required to disclose any 
192         Video Renewal Course: Real Estate Made Reel™outstanding offers or other factors affecting the seller’s decision to sell 
when the broker exercises the option. [Rattray v. Scudder (1946) 28 
C2d 214]
The broker’s exercise of a purchase option contained in a listing 
agreement requires the broker to disclose to the seller the full amount 
of the broker’s earnings (profit). Further, they need to obtain the 
seller’s written consent to the earnings before or at the time the broker 
exercises the option. [Calif. Business and Professions Code §10176(h)]
A dilemma may arise when market prices rapidly increase after the 
seller’s broker exercises their option to purchase, allowing for a quick 
resale by the broker at a profit. On discovery, the seller may claim the 
profit is theirs and demand it be paid to them under the belief they 
have been cheated by the broker.  
Thus, as with net listings, option listings are to be used with great care, 
if at all. The option is only exercised after full disclosure by the broker 
about: 
• all material facts relating to the property not known or 
understood by the seller;
• the identity of all potential buyers and their offers ; and
• any market or use conditions relating to the property known 
to the broker which have a current positive effect on its 
value.Option Listing Variation         1931. An option listing is a variation of the:
a. open listing. 
b. net listing. 
c. exclusive right-to-sell listing.
2. Under an option listing, the broker: 
a. is granted an option to buy the property at a predetermined

b. only has a best-effort obligation to locate a buyer for the 
property. 
c. grants the seller the option to sell the property to the broker at 
a predetermined price.
3. The concurrent status of agent and principal under an option listing 
creates a __________ for the broker.
a. dual agency situation 
b. conflict of interest
c. existential crisis 194         Video Renewal Course: Real Estate Made Reel™
Guaranteed Sale Variation 
A guaranteed sale listing  is also usually a variation of the exclusive 
right-to-sell listing. Brokers have been known to use the guarantee 
feature to boost sales activity during recessionary periods and when 
inventories of available properties are long.  
A guaranteed sale listing is distinct from a regular, exclusive right-to-sell 
listing. Here, the broker grants their seller the option to sell, the broker 
agreeing to buy, called a put. The seller is given the right to call on the 
broker to buy the property at a predetermined price if the property 
does not sell during the listing period. In this respect, the guaranteed 
sale listing establishes a reverse role for the seller from the option listing 
when the property fails to sell during the listing period.  
The difference with the guaranteed sale listing is that the seller, not the 
broker, has the right to exercise the option by accepting the broker’s 
promise to buy the listed property.  
The guaranteed sale variation is attractive to sellers who, on account 
of job transfers, sudden unemployment or other financial factors, are 
motivated to sell at all costs. The benefit to the seller is the assurance 
of a back-up, last-resort sale during recessionary periods of market 
uncertainty — a risk some brokers are willing to take.  Guaranteed Sale Variation             195As with the option listing, the broker may tend not to work the listing 
vigorously if the price they have agreed to pay under the guarantee 
(put option) is much lower than the amount the seller is able to net on 
a sale at current market prices. Thus, the broker stands to acquire the 
property at a bargain price if it does not sell during the listing period.  
In practice, if a buyer is not produced during the listing period, a 
desperate seller may have no choice but to sell to the broker. The 
seller under the exclusive listing has delegated complete control to 
the broker to locate a buyer.  
The broker’s advantage, however, is lessened by a DRE regulation 
which prohibits the inclusion of advance fee provisions in a guaranteed 
sale listing. [Department of Real Estate Regulations §2970(b)(5)]
As always, the broker is required to disclose all offers and the status 
of potential offers during the listing period and at the time the seller 
exercises their option to sell to the broker. 
Other listings
Other listing variations contain provisions for the broker to: 
• obtain a tenant for a landlord; 
• lease a property for a tenant; 
• arrange a mortgage on behalf of a borrower who 
owns real estate or holds a mortgage note offered as 
collateral; and 
• find a borrower for a lender seeking to make a mortgage. 
Unimproved real estate, business opportunities and mobile 
homes can also be the subject of the employment. All of 
these employment variations may be used with the open or 
exclusive type of listing agreements. 196         Video Renewal Course: Real Estate Made Reel™1. Under a guaranteed sale listing:

Operating Under a Buyer’s Listing
The exclusive right-to-buy listing agreement
When an owner decides to sell a property, they tend to first look for 
an agent to assist in disposing of the property and completing the 
work needed to field a buyer. Rarely do sellers attempt to find buyers 
themselves.  
The cyclical exceptions are for sale by owner (FSBO) sellers , who 
venture out alone during boom-time seller’s markets. FSBO sellers 
market their property in an effort to locate buyers, as do agents. Their 
sole intention is to avoid retaining brokerage services and paying fees.
In contrast, when an individual decides they might like to own a 
home, they start the search by driving through neighborhoods and 
visiting online multiple listing service (MLS) publications to see what is 
available.  They do not first think about brokers and agents as helpers 
in this pursuit.  
Their search is not initially for an agent who they might like to work 
with – retain – to locate a property. Instead, they investigate a listed 
property they have located (or drop in at an open house).  That is 
typically their first encounter with a real estate agent.198         Video Renewal Course: Real Estate Made Reel™Thus, by some sort of history or training, owners seeking to sell a property 
turn to real estate agents, while buyers seeking to locate a property 
do not.  As a result, the first agent a buyer contacts is a seller’s agent, 
a quasi-adversarial individual – their duty being honesty, not advice 
and assistance – with selling a property on their mind and not locating 
a property for the prospective buyer of the listed property.
During one of these contacts, an owner’s agent may suggest to the 
buyer that they can help find them the property they are looking for. 
Here, the owner’s agent transforms themselves into a buyer’s agent. 
The triggering event is the buyer’s lack of any further interest in the 
listed property the agent is giving them information on.   
Opportunity first, then commitment
A buyer who feels comfortable with the agent will talk and answer 
questions about their property requirements, size, location and pricing 
– property information sought by the agent. Here, the discussion has 
dramatically shifted from selling a property to finding a property, as 
described by the buyer.  
At some point, with this agent or another, the buyer acquires the 
confidence to involve themselves with a particular agent in the search. 
For the moment, they have an agent.
A commitment? Possibly, but this is not yet known to the agent. 
The agent lacks the solicitation by a thoughtful presentation of a 
written authorization – a buyer’s listing agreement – to be entered into 
by the buyer before the agent starts the hunt.  
So far, the agent has only enough information to determine whether 
they have a reasonable opportunity, if they go to work for  this buyer, 
to locate a suitable property, make an offer which is accepted and 
receive a fee on closing. The agent may need to counsel the buyer 
more before asking for the commitment to retain the agent as their 
exclusive buyer’s agent.The exclusive right-to-buy listing agreement            199The exclusive right to render services
An exclusive right-to-buy listing agreement is used by brokers and 
their agents to prepare and submit to prospective buyers their offer 
to render services on their behalf as the buyer’s real estate agent. 
Under it, you are employed to locate property sought by the buyer in 
exchange for the buyer’s assurance you will be paid a fee when the 
buyer acquires the type of property they seek. [ See RPI Form 103] 
A buyer who refuses to enter into a written listing agreement with a 
broker and their agent demonstrates a clear intention the buyer does 
not want them as their representative. What this unlisted buyer likely 
wants is an agent to act as a locator  or finder of properties, providing 
valuable information without any obligation to compensate them for 
the assistance.  Possibly, the buyer has not yet committed themselves 
to buy a property; “just looking, thank you very much.”   
Without the buyer’s written promise to pay a fee, you’re entitled to 
nothing when your buyer “goes around” you and acquires property 
on which you provided them with information.
Without the buyer’s written promise, no fee has been earned which 
is collectable from anyone, unless you arranged a fee-sharing 
agreement with the seller’s broker documenting the buyer as your 
client, a condition which presents other risks. [ See RPI Form 103]  200         Video Renewal Course: Real Estate Made Reel™1. Under an exclusive right-to-buy listing agreement, the broker and 
agent are employed to:
a. originate a trust deed mortgage on the client’s behalf.
b. locate property sought by the buyer.
c. solicit, identify and refer potential clients to other brokers.
2. Which of the following statements is most correct about a buyer’s 
listing agreement?
a. A signed buyer’s listing agreement produces the maximum 
financial return for the effort, money and talent invested when 
representing an individual interested in buying property.
b. Under California agency law, an orally negotiated buyer’s 
listing agreement carries the same degree of fee protection as 
a written listing agreement. 
c. A buyer who refuses to enter into a written listing agreement 
with a broker and their agent demonstrates a clear intention 
they want highest form of representation possible. 
3. What other real estate participant is an unlisted buyer most similar 
to? 
a. A sale by owner (FSBO) seller since both seek to avoid retaining 
brokerage services and paying fees. 
b. A seller since both have the exclusive representation from a 
broker and agent. 
c. An escrow officer since both perform real estate-related 
activities.Agency duties owed to buyers           201
Agency duties owed to buyers
Special agency duties are owed to a buyer when a broker and their 
agents undertake to locate property on the buyer’s behalf. The duty 
to the buyer first arises when the broker:  
• enters  into an exclusive right-to-buy agreement with the buyer; 
or  
• presents property information to an unlisted buyer who they 
have agreed to assist by locating qualifying properties suitable 
to the buyer.  
When representing a buyer under a written exclusive right-to-buy 
employment agreement, the broker (and their agents) has entered 
into a bilateral employment agreement. 
Such an employment obligates the 
broker, through their agents, to exercise 
due diligence by way of a constant and 
continuing search to locate qualifying 
properties, while keeping the buyer 
informed of their progress.  
Without an exclusive right-to-buy listing, 
the brokerage duties which exist to locate LISTING AGREEMENT202         Video Renewal Course: Real Estate Made Reel™properties for a buyer are best-effort obligations created by an oral 
(or written) open listing, called a unilateral employment agreement. A 
best-effort obligation requires no affirmative action (diligence) on the 
part of the broker’s office to locate property.  
However, under a buyer’s listing, be it a written exclusive or oral open, 
the act of delivering property information to the buyer they are assisting 
obligates the broker and agents to use due diligence in their efforts to:  
• gather readily available data  on the property under review;  
• assist in the analysis and consequences of the property data 
gathered; and  
• advise the buyer regarding the property and any proposed 
transaction in a conscientious effort to act honestly, and to care 
for and protect the buyer’s best interests.  
When acting as the buyer’s agent regarding the acquisition of a 
particular property, due diligence includes: 
• disclosing facts about the integrity of the property; and 
• recommending investigative activity which the agent knows 
might influence the buyer’s conduct in negotiations.  
Without an exclusive employment with a buyer on whose behalf the 
agent is locating properties, the agent is reduced to a mere “locator” 
or “finder.” Worse, the buyer’s agent is burdened with affirmative 
agency duties of utmost care and protection owed their buyer when 
reviewing properties listed with other brokers even if they are not 
acting under a written exclusive right-to-buy listing agreement with 
that buyer. 
The fee-payment bargain
Various working relationships and compensation 
arrangements may be struck between a prospective buyer 
and their agent.  Agency duties owed to buyers           203Writings, by their nature, are intended by all who enter into 
them to be enforced. This includes a signed buyer’s listing 
calling for payment of a fee when the buyer’s objective of 
acquiring property is met. 
Editor’s note — All assurances of a brokerage fee on a real 
estate transaction are required by contract law (Statute 
of Frauds) to be in writing and signed by the person who 
agreed a fee will be paid, regardless of whether the fee will 
be paid by that person or by another party to the transaction. 
[Phillippe v. Shapell Industries, Inc.  (1987) 43 C3d 1247]
The following situations demonstrate the various likelihoods 
of collecting a fee for assisting a buyer:  
1. No listing exists. Neither the seller nor the buyer has 
formally employed a broker. Usually, the seller acting 
without a broker is an experienced real estate investor, 
subdivider, land speculator, real estate owned property 
(REO) lender or other well-seasoned owner capable 
of negotiating a real estate transaction without 
representation.  
2. A “one-shot” seller’s listing exists. A buyer is willing to 
make an offer through an agent who located an 
unlisted property (and other properties) at the buyer’s 
request and brought it to the buyer’s attention. [See RPI 
Form 103-1]
The agent fails to have the buyer enter into an exclusive 
right-to-buy listing. Before preparing and submitting an 
offer from the buyer, the agent solicits the seller for and 
obtains a “one-shot” right-to-sell listing containing a 
promise to pay a fee. On getting the listing, the agent 
prepares and submits an offer from the buyer.
3. Customer turned client. An agent employed by a broker 
in an office with numerous listed properties is contacted 204         Video Renewal Course: Real Estate Made Reel™by a prospective buyer. The buyer is exposed to all 
the relevant “in-house” listings, none of which are of 
immediate interest to the buyer. Having exhausted the 
in-house inventory of property for sale by clients, the 
agent may choose to see the buyer off. Or, the agent 
might better consider making arrangements with the 
buyer to locate qualifying properties listed by other 
brokers and unlisted properties (For Sale By Owners 
(FSBOs)), and present them to the buyer.  
If the buyer agrees, the agent is to locate qualifying 
properties, the agent needs to first ask for and obtain 
a signed buyer’s listing agreement. If the agent is to 
be assured payment of a fee when the buyer acquires 
property, the buyer needs to enter into a buyer’s listing 
agreement. 
4. A buyer’s listing agreement exists. The agent’s broker is 
employed by the buyer in a signed exclusive right-to-
buy listing agreement to represent the buyer by locating 
and negotiating the purchase of suitable property of 
the type sought by the buyer. [See RPI Form 103] 
A seller of suitable property may or may not have 
signed a seller’s listing agreement with another broker. 
Either way, the buyer’s broker controls the amount and 
destiny of their fee to be paid when their buyer buys.  Agency duties owed to buyers           2051. When representing a buyer under a written exclusive right-to-buy

inspections or structural pest control inspections.
c. Both a. and b.206         Video Renewal Course: Real Estate Made Reel™
Provisions for payment of a fee
An exclusive right-to-buy agreement contains the same operative 
provisions found in exclusive right-to-sell agreements. [See RPI Form 
103]  
In exchange for the broker’s promise to use due diligence while 
rendering services to comply with their end of the employment bargain, 
the buyer promises in the exclusive right-to-buy listing agreement to 
pay the broker a specific fee. 
Fees are either a fixed dollar amount or a percentage of the price 
paid, but may be set as an hourly rate. Fixed and percentage fees 
are contingent fees.  They are earned when the buyer enters into a 
binding purchase agreement during the (buyer’s) listing period to 
acquire the type of property described in the buyer’s listing.  
However, buyers, like sellers, often do not enter into a purchase 
agreement during the period of employment. Thus, on expiration of 
the listing, the buyer’s broker has not earned a fee. An event triggering 
payment of the promised fee has not yet occurred.
The fee provisions in a buyer’s listing agreement include a safety 
clause which provides added protection against a lost fee for services Provisions for payment of a fee           207rendered in regard to specific properties during the listing period. [See 
RPI Form 103-1 §5.1(c)]  
Under the safety clause, the buyer’s broker is entitled to collect a fee 
if, within an agreed-to period after the expiration of the buyer’s listing:  
• information specific to the property was provided to the buyer 
by the buyer’s agent during the listing period;  
• on expiration of the buyer’s listing, the buyer is handed an 
itemized list which identifies those properties the buyer’s agent 
brought to the buyer’s attention needed to perfect  the broker’s 
right to a fee [ See RPI Form 123];  
• the buyer entered into negotiations with the owner of a registered 
property; and 
• the safety-period negotiations ultimately resulted in the buyer 
acquiring an interest in the property.  
Buyer’s liability for the brokerage fee
The buyer under a listing agreement promises to pay a full brokerage 
fee on the acquisition of property. However, in practice the buyer will 
nearly always close the purchase without directly paying the promised 
brokerage fee. It is the seller who typically pays the fee the buyer has 
promised their agent. 
Further, when the property purchased is listed with another broker, the 
buyer’s broker will typically accept a lesser amount for their fee than 
the fee amount the buyer agreed to pay under the buyer’s listing.   
Can the broker enforce the fee arrangement in the buyer’s listing and 
recover the balance of the agreed-to fee from the buyer when the 
buyer’s broker accepts a lesser fee from the seller or the seller’s broker?  
No! The buyer’s obligation to pay the brokerage fee is fully satisfied  
when the buyer’s broker agrees to accept a fee from the seller or the 
seller’s broker, which is nearly always the case. [See RPI Form 103 §4.2] 208         Video Renewal Course: Real Estate Made Reel™Buyer’s listing agreement

purpose and need for enforcement. The sections include:  
• Brokerage services: The employment period for 
rendering brokerage services and the broker’s due

Mandated on one-to-four residential units
The seller of a one-to-four unit residential property completes and

Disclosure Statement (TDS), more generically called a Condition of 
Property Disclosure Statement. [Calif. Civil Code §§1102(a), 1102.3;

to review its content. [CC §1102.7]
When preparing the TDS, the seller sets forth any property defects 
known or suspected to exist by the seller.  
Any conditions known to the seller which might negatively affect the 
value and desirability of the property for a prospective buyer are to 
be disclosed, even though they may not be an item listed on the TDS.

WITH SECTION 1102 OF THE CIVIL CODE AS OF _____________, 20______. IT IS NOT A WARRANTY OF ANY KIND 
BY THE SELLER(S) OR ANY AGENT(S) REPRESENTING ANY PRINCIPAL(S) IN THIS TRANSACTION, AND IS NOT A 
SUBSTITUTE FOR ANY INSPECTIONS OR WARRANTIES THE PRINCIPAL(S) MAY WISH TO OBTAIN.

COORDINATION WITH OTHER DISCLOSURE FORMS
This Real Estate Transfer Disclosure Statement is made pursuant to Section 1102 of the Civil Code. Other statutes require 
disclosures, depending upon the details of the particular real estate transaction (for example: special study zones and 
purchase-money liens on residential property).
Substituted Disclosures: The following disclosures and other disclosures required by law, including the Natural Hazard 
Disclosure Report/Statement that may include airport annoyances, earthquake, fire, flood, or special assessment information, 
have or will be made in connection with this real estate transfer, and are intended to satisfy the disclosure obligations on this 
form, where the subject matter is the same:
� Inspection reports completed pursuant to the contract of sale or receipt for deposit.
� Additional inspection reports or disclosures:

agreement, is void as against public policy. 
Controlled and exempt sellers
Unless a seller is exempt, sellers of one-to-four unit residential real estate 
are required to fill out and furnish buyers with a statutory TDS when 
entering into a purchase agreement. [CC §1102]
Transactions which exempt the seller (but not the seller’s agent) 
from preparing and delivering the statutory TDS to the buyer include 
transfers:  
• by court order, such as probate, eminent domain or bankruptcy;  
• by judicial foreclosure or trustee’s sale;  
• on the resale of real estate owned property acquired by a lender 
on a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure, or by foreclosure;  
• from co-owner to co-owner;  
• from parent to child;  
• from spouse to spouse, including property settlements resulting 
from a dissolution of marriage;  
• by tax sale;  
• by reversion of unclaimed property to the state; and  
• from or to any government agency. [CC §1102.2]
The best property disclosure tool for exempt sellers is the preparation 
and delivery of the statutory TDS form (and a property inspector’s 
report) to prospective buyers or buyer’s agents on every type of 
transaction. If the transaction is exempt or concerns property other 
than one-to-four residential units, the form as a practical matter needs 
to be used.  216         Video Renewal Course: Real Estate Made Reel™1. The seller of a one-to-four-unit residential property completes 
and delivers to a prospective buyer a statutory form called a(n) 
__________, more generically called a Condition of Property

a. abstract of title
b. Agency Law Disclosure
c. Transfer Disclosure Statement (TDS)
2. When preparing the Transfer Disclosure Statement (TDS), the seller 
discloses:
a. any property defects known or suspected to exist by the seller.  
b. any conflicts of interest which may alter their dealings with the 
buyer. 
c. the existence of any financial judgements which may cloud 
the title to the property. 
3. A buyer cannot waive delivery of the statutorily-mandated Transfer 
Disclosure Statement (TDS) on the sale of a nonexempt one-to-four 
unit residential real estate. Any attempted waiver is __________ as 
against public policy. 
a. void
b. voidable
c. acceptable, so long as it is in writingDelivery of the disclosure statement           217
Delivery of the disclosure statement
While it is the seller who prepares the Transfer Disclosure Statement 
(TDS), the TDS is delivered to the buyer by the agent who directly 
receives the purchase agreement offer from the buyer. [See RPI Form 
304] 
The failure of the seller or any of the agents involved to deliver the 
seller’s TDS to the buyer will not invalidate a sales transaction after 
it has closed. However, the seller and the seller’s broker are both 
liable for the actual monetary losses incurred by the buyer due to an 
undisclosed defect known to them. [Calif. Civil Code §1102.13]
The TDS is handed to the buyer before the seller accepts a purchase 
agreement offer submitted by a buyer.  If the TDS is delivered to the 
buyer after the seller enters into a purchase agreement, the delivery is 
untimely in violation of TDS rules, and the buyer may:  
• cancel the purchase agreement on discovery of undisclosed 
defects known to the seller or the seller’s agent and unknown 
and unobserved by the buyer or the buyer’s agent prior to 
acceptance; [CC §1102.3]
• make a demand on the seller to correct the defects or reduce 
the price accordingly before escrow closes [See RPI Form 150 ]; 218         Video Renewal Course: Real Estate Made Reel™or  
• close escrow and make a demand on the seller for the costs to 
cure the defects. [ Jue v. Smiser (1994) 23 CA4th 312]
Buyer’s right to cancel on delayed disclosure
The TDS is to be delivered to prospective buyer as soon as 
practicable on commencement of negotiations. As with the 
delivery of the Natural Hazard Disclosure Statement (NHDS), 
which has been dictated by the California Attorney General 
to be delivered ASAP, the TDS is delivered before entry into 
a purchase agreement. [Calif. Attorney General Opinion 01-
406 (August 24, 2001)]
If the TDS is belatedly delivered to the buyer — after the 
buyer and seller enter into a purchase agreement — the 
buyer may elect to cancel the purchase agreement under 
a statutory three-day right to cancel. The buyer’s statutory 
cancellation right runs for three days following the day the 
TDS is actually handed to the buyer (five days if delivered by 
mail). [CC §1102.3]
Demand to cure an undisclosed material defect
As an alternative remedy to canceling the purchase 
agreement on receipt of an unacceptable TDS, the buyer 
may make a demand on the seller to cure any undisclosed 
material defect (affecting value) known to the seller or the 
seller’s agent prior to entering into the purchase agreement. 
If the seller’s agent knew or is charged with knowledge of the 
undisclosed defects at the time the buyer and seller entered 
into the purchase agreement, the buyer’s demand to cure 
the material defect may also be made on the seller’s agent. 
[See RPI Form 269] 
If the seller will not voluntarily cure the defects on demand, Delivery of the disclosure statement           219the buyer may close escrow and recover the cost incurred 
(or valuation lost) to correct the defect without concern for 
the purchase agreement contingency provision stating the 
alternative statutory right to cancel the transaction. Defects 
known  and undisclosed, or inaccurately disclosed, by the 
seller or the seller’s agent at the time the seller accepts the 
buyer’s purchase offer impose liability on those who knew or 
are charged with knowledge. [Jue, supra]
Another alternative for the buyer is to perform on the 
purchase agreement by tendering a price reduced  by the 
cost to repair or replace the defects known to the seller and 
untimely disclosed or discovered by the buyer while under 
contract. [See RPI Form 150]  220         Video Renewal Course: Real Estate Made Reel™1. While it is the seller who prepares the Transfer Disclosure Statement 
(TDS), the TDS is delivered to the buyer:
a. by the buyer’s agent upon the buyer’s inquiry into the property. 
b. by the seller’s agent who receives the purchase agreement 
offer from the buyer.
c. by the seller when the buyer first voices legitimate interest in the 
property. 
2. If the Transfer Disclosure Statement (TDS) is not timely delivered to 
the buyer:
a. the closed sale will be invalidated and the buyer and seller 
returned to their respective positions they held prior to entering 
into the transaction. 
b. the seller and the seller’s broker are both liable for the actual 
monetary losses incurred by the buyer due to an undisclosed

Include a home inspector
A competent seller’s agent will aggressively recommend the seller 
retain a home inspector before they market the property.  The 
inspector hired will conduct a physical examination of the property 
to determine the condition of its component parts, known as a home 
inspection.
On the home inspector’s completion of their examination, a home 
inspection report (HIR) will be prepared on their observations and 
findings, which is forwarded to the seller’s agent. 
A home inspector often detects and reports property defects 
overlooked by the seller and not observed during a visual inspection 
by the seller’s agent. Significant defects which remain undisclosed at 
the time the buyer goes under contract tend to surface during escrow 
or after closing as claims against the seller’s broker for deceit. A home 
inspector troubleshoots for defects not observed or observable to the 
seller’s agent’s eye. [Calif. Business and Professions Code §7195]
To greatly reduce the potential of buyer claims, and eliminate to the 
extent possible the risk of negligent property improvement disclosures, 
the HIR is coupled with preparation of the seller’s TDS. Both are 
presented to buyers before the seller accepts an offer.Include a home inspector          223Hiring a home inspector
Sellers and seller’s agents are encouraged by legislative policy to 
obtain and rely on the content of an HIR to prepare their TDS for 
delivery to prospective buyers. 
The buyer’s reliance on an HIR at the time a purchase agreement 
is entered into relieves the seller and their agent of any liability for 
property defects they did not know about or were not observable 
during the mandatory visual inspection conducted by the seller’s 
agent.
However, for the seller’s agent to avoid liability in the preparation the 
TDS by relying on an HIR, the seller’s agent needs to select a competent 
home inspector to inspect and prepare the HIR. Thus, the seller’s agent 
needs to exercise ordinary care  when selecting the home inspector.
A home inspector’s qualifications 
Any individual who holds themselves out as being in the 
business of conducting a home inspection and preparing 
a home inspection report on a one-to-four unit residential 
property is a home inspector. No licensing scheme exists to 
set the minimum standard of competency or qualifications 
necessary to enter the home inspection profession. [Calif. 
Business and Professions Code §7195(d)]
However, some real estate service providers typically 
conduct home inspections, such as:
• general contractors;
• structural pest control operators;
• architects; and
• registered engineers. 
Home inspectors occasionally do not hold any type of 224         Video Renewal Course: Real Estate Made Reel™license relating to construction, such as a person who is a 
construction worker or building department employee. 
However, they are required to conduct an inspection of 
a property with the same “degree of care” a reasonably 
prudent home inspector would exercise to locate material 
defects during their physical examination of the property 
and report their findings. [Bus & P C §7196]
The inspection and report
A home inspection is a physical examination conducted on-site by 
a home inspector. The inspection of a one-to-four unit residential 
property is performed for a noncontingent fee.  
The purpose of the physical examination of the premises is to identify 
material defects in the condition of the structure and its systems 
and components. Material defects are conditions which affect the 
property’s:  
• market value;  
• desirability as a dwelling;  
• habitability from the elements; and  
• safety from injury in its use as a dwelling.  
Defects are material if they adversely affect the price a reasonably 
prudent and informed buyer would pay for the property when 
entering into a purchase agreement. As the report may affect value, 
the investigation and delivery of the home inspection report to a 
prospective buyer is legislated to precede a prospective buyer’s offer 
to purchase. [Bus & P C §7195(b)]
The home inspection is a non-invasive examination of the mechanical, 
electrical and plumbing systems of the dwelling, as well as the 
components of the structure, such as the roof, ceiling, walls, floors and 
foundations. Include a home inspector          225Non-invasive indicates no intrusion into the roof, walls, foundation or 
soil by dismantling or taking apart the structure which would disturb 
components or cause repairs to be made to remove the effects of 
the intrusion. [Bus & P C §7195(a)(1)]
The home inspection report is the written report prepared by the home 
inspector which sets forth the findings while conducting the physical 
examination of the property. The report identifies each system and 
component of the structure inspected, describes any material defects 
the home inspector found or suspects, makes recommendations 
about the conditions observed and suggests any further evaluation 
needed to be undertaken by other experts. [Bus & P C §7195(c)]226         Video Renewal Course: Real Estate Made Reel™1. A home inspector’s primary function is to: 
a. inspect a property to arrive at an informed opinion of its fair 
market value (FMV) which will form the ceiling for what the 
buyer will offer for the property. 
b. determine whether any natural hazards pose a significant risk 
to the property, such as flooding or excessive fire risks. 
c. conduct a physical examination of a property to determine 
the condition of its component parts.
2. On a home inspector’s completion of their examination, a(n) 
__________ is prepared on their observations and findings.
a. appraisal report 
b. home inspection report (HIR)
c. Transfer Disclosure Statement (TDS)
3. The home inspection is a(n) __________ of the mechanical, electrical 
and plumbing systems of the dwelling, as well as the components of 
the structure, such as the roof, ceiling, walls, floors and foundations.
a. minimally invasive examination 
b. invasive examination 
c. non-invasive examinationMandatory inspection by the seller’s broker           227
Mandatory inspection by the seller’s broker
A seller’s agent (or seller’s broker) is obligated to personally carry out 
a competent visual inspection of the property. The seller’s disclosures 
and defects noted in the home inspection report (HIR) are entered on 
the Transfer Disclosure Statement (TDS) and reviewed by the seller’s 
agent for discrepancies. [See RPI Form 304] 
The seller’s agent then adds any information about their knowledge 
of material defects which have gone undisclosed by the seller (or the 
home inspector).
A buyer has two years from the close of 
escrow to pursue the seller’s broker and agent 
to recover losses caused by the broker’s or 
agent’s negligent failure to disclose observable 
and known defects affecting the property’s 
physical condition and value. Undisclosed 
and unknown defects permitting recovery are 
those observable by a reasonably competent 
broker during a visual on-site inspection. A 
seller’s agent is expected to be as competent 
as their broker in an inspection. [Calif. Civil 
Code §2079.4]TDS228         Video Renewal Course: Real Estate Made Reel™However, the buyer will be unable to recover their losses from the 
seller’s broker if the seller’s broker or agent inspected the property 
and would not have observed the defect and did not actually know 
it existed. [CC §1102.4(a)]
Following their mandatory visual inspection, the seller’s broker or agent 
needs to make disclosures on the seller’s TDS in full reliance on specific 
items covered in a home inspector’s report the seller obtained on the 
property. If the HIR is relied on after the seller’s agent property inspection 
when preparing the TDS and the TDS is later contested by the buyer as 
incorrect or inadequate in a claim on the broker, the broker and their 
agent are entitled to indemnification – held harmless – from the home 
inspection company issuing the report. [Leko v. Cornerstone Building 
Inspection Service (2001) 86 CA4th 1109]Mandatory inspection by the seller’s broker           2291. A seller’s agent is obligated to personally carry out a(n) __________

c. invasive mechanical inspection

c. five years
3. Undisclosed and unknown defects permitting recovery from the

Environmental Hazards and Annoyances
Noxious man-made hazards
Environmental hazards are noxious or annoying conditions which are 
man-made hazards, not natural hazards. As environmental hazards, 
the conditions are classified as either:  
• injurious  to the health of humans; or  
• an interference with an individual’s sensitivities.  
In further analysis, environmental hazards which affect the occupant 
in use and enjoyment of the property are either:
• located on the property; or 
• originate from sources located elsewhere.
Hazards on the property
Environmental hazards located on the property which pose a direct 
health threat on occupants due to construction materials, the design 
of the construction, the soil or its location, include:  
• asbestos-containing building materials and products used for 
insulation, fire protection and the strengthening of materials 232         Video Renewal Course: Real Estate Made Reel™[Calif. Health and Safety Code §§25915 et seq.];
• formaldehyde used in the composition of construction materials 
[Calif. Civil Code §2079.7(a); Calif. Business and Professions Code 
§10084.1];
• radon gas concentrations in enclosed, unventilated spaces 
located within a building where the underlying rock contains 
uranium [CC §2079.7(a); Bus & P C §10084.1];
• hazardous waste from materials, products or substances which 
are toxic, corrosive, ignitable or reactive [Health & S C §25359.7; 
Bus & P C §10084.1];
• toxic mold; [Health & S C §§26140, 26147]
• smoke from the combustion of materials, products, supplies 
or substances located on or within the building [Health & S C 
§§13113.7, 13113.8];
• security bars which might interfere with an occupant’s ability to 
exit a room in order to avoid another hazard, such as a fire [CC 
§1102.16; Health & S C §13113.9]; and  
• lead. 
Environmental hazards located off the property, but which have an 
adverse effect on the use of the property due to noise, vibrations, 
odors or some other ability to inflict harm, include:  
• military ordnance  sites within one mile of the property [CC 
§1102.15];
• industrial zoning in the neighborhood of 
the property [CC §1102.17];
• airport influence areas established 
by local airport land commissions 
[CC §§1103.4(c), 1353; Bus & P C 
§11010(b)(13); see RPI Form 308 ]; 
and
• ground transportation arteries which 
include train tracks and major highways 
in close proximity to the property.  Noxious man-made hazards            233Formaldehyde gas emissions
Formaldehyde  is a colorless, pungent gas contained in most organic 
solvents which are used in paints, plastics, resins, pressed-wood 
fiberboard materials, urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI), 
curtains and upholstery textiles. Gas emitted from these materials and 
products contains formaldehyde.  
Formaldehyde is a probable carcinogen which is likely to cause cancer 
in humans who inhale the gas emitted by formaldehyde-containing 
material.  
The use of UFFI occurred in construction during the 1970s and was 
banned in residential property constructed after 1982. However, 
formaldehyde emissions decrease over time. As a result, properties 
built during the 1970s and early 1980s with formaldehyde-containing 
materials give off levels of formaldehyde no greater than newly 
constructed homes. Over time, emissions decrease to undetectable 
levels. However, an increase in humidity and temperature will increase 
the level of emissions.  
Radon gas in soil
Radon is a naturally-occurring radioactive gas. It is not visible, cannot 
be tasted and has no odor. Radon gas is located in soils with a 
concentration of uranium in the rock, e.g., granite or shale, beneath 
it.  
Radon is a known human carcinogen and enters a building from the 
soil beneath the structure. 
Radon is sucked into ground floor residential space by interior heating 
on cold weather days and the use of exhaust fans in the kitchen and 
bathrooms since these conditions create a vacuum within the lower 
area of the structure.  
However, California residences rarely experience elevated and harmful 
levels of radon gas emission. Radon does appear in approximately one 
percent of housing in California. Proper ventilation avoids the buildup 
of harmful concentrations of radon in a home or other enclosed 234         Video Renewal Course: Real Estate Made Reel™space, a function of its design and operation.  
Hazardous waste on site
Waste is hazardous if it has the potential to harm human health or 
the environment. Hazardous waste is released into the environment, 
primarily the soil, by the leaking of underground storage tanks, drum 
containers, poorly contained landfills or ponds, accidental spills or 
illegal dumping.
Hazardous waste materials include any product, material or substance 
which is toxic, corrosive, ignitable or reactive, such as is generated 
by oil, gas, petrochemical and electronics industries, and dry cleaner 
and print shops.  
Information is available to prospective buyers on their inquiry into the 
location and status of hazardous waste sites in the vicinity of a home 
from the “Cortese list” maintained by the California Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA).  
Mold: the rogue in vogue
Mold produces spores which become airborne. There are many 
different kinds of spores, each having differing effects, if any, on 
humans. Some may be a mere annoyance, irritating the sensitivities 
of an individual. Others might be a threat to the health of those who 
inhale them.  
The uncertainty of the toxic nature of mold spores has led to a sort of 
intellectual moratorium on determining just what kinds of molds have 
an adverse or harmful effect on humans. 
It has also spawned a number of lawsuits as the unknown nature of 
“toxic mold” has been allowed by politicians and lawyers to stir the 
fears of the general public.
Sellers are under no obligation to investigate whether the improvements 
contain mold. If it is known the structure does contain mold, the seller 
has no obligation to determine if the mold is a threat to human health.  Noxious man-made hazards            235The DHS has not yet set any standards for disclosures regarding the 
existence of mold or guidelines for the remediation of mold threats. 
However, the DHS has published multiple consumer-oriented booklets 
on mold on its website at www.cdph.ca.gov.
Until uniform disclosure standards are produced and implemented, the 
prospective buyer will receive only a generic informational brochure 
and a writing from the seller and the seller’s agent in the form of a TDS 
advising the buyer of any awareness or knowledge the seller or the 
seller’s agent may have that mold exists on the property. No common 
knowledge exists for sellers or seller’s agents to visually distinguish 
between harmful and benign molds.  
If the seller is aware of mold, regardless of type, the seller is to disclose 
any awareness of the mold’s existence, as well as any other reports or 
knowledge about the variety of mold which exists.  236         Video Renewal Course: Real Estate Made Reel™1. __________ are noxious or annoying conditions which are man-

Visual inspection and method of disclosure
Environmental hazards have an adverse effect on a property’s value 
and desirability. Thus, they are considered defects which, if known, 
are disclosed as material facts: the hazards might affect a prospective 
buyer’s decision to purchase the property.  
The disclosure to prospective buyers of environmental hazards related 
to a property known to a seller’s and seller’s agent is required on the 
sale, exchange or lease of all types of property.  
While the disclosure of an environmental hazard is the obligation of 
the seller, it is the seller’s agent who has the agency duty of care and 
protection owed to the seller to place them in compliance with the 
environmental hazard disclosure requirements.  
Further, and more critically, the seller’s agent also has an additional, 
more limited duty owed to prospective buyers of the listed property. 
The seller’s agent on taking a listing will personally conduct a visual 
inspection of the property for environmental hazards (as well as 
physical defects), and do so with a level of competence equal to 
that of their broker. In turn, the seller’s agent uses a Transfer Disclosure 
Statement (TDS) form to advise prospective buyers of their observations 
(and knowledge) about conditions which constitute environmental 238         Video Renewal Course: Real Estate Made Reel™hazards. [Calif. Civil Code §2079; see RPI Form 304] 
Further, a seller’s agent uses RPI Form 308 to disclose the existence of 
unique environmental factors or conditions that were not referenced 
in the boilerplate language of the TDS which may adversely affect 
the property or its immediate vicinity, such as the close proximity of an 
industrial use zone. [ See RPI Form 308]
To conclude the seller’s agent’s disclosure of environmental hazards 
and eliminate any further duty to advise the prospective buyer about 
the environmental hazards, the seller’s agent delivers, or confirms 
the buyer’s agent has delivered a copy of the environmental hazard 
booklet approved by the California Department of Health and Safety 
(DHS) to the buyer. Delivery of the booklet is confirmed in writing 
through a provision in the purchase agreement. [See RPI Form 150 
§12.6; See RPI Form 316-1] 
Included in the booklet is a discussion about the significance of 
hazardous materials and conditions, and tips for identifying, locating 
and mitigating the hazards. Also discussed are the symptoms 
experienced by humans that result from the hazards. 
Delivery of the booklet — by hand or digitally — in conjunction with 
the TDS and its factual disclosures concludes the seller’s agent’s 
disclosure of environmental hazards and eliminates any further duty 
they have  to advise the prospective buyer about the existence of 
environmental hazards. [CC §2079.8]
Thus, when a hazardous condition disclosed in the TDS is addressed in 
the booklet, the disclosure of the condition in the TDS together with the 
booklet covers the extent to which the seller’s agent goes to provide 
a full disclosure about the existence and nature of that hazardous 
condition. For the purposes of the seller’s side of the transaction, the 
agent and seller need to say nothing more to the buyer beyond timely 
providing them the TDS and the booklet to make the disclosures, unless 
the buyer inquires further — which requires an honest and complete 
response.

protection owed to their seller to see to it the seller is in compliance 
with the environmental hazard disclosure requirements.
The buyer’s agent’s review as their risk mitigation
When the seller or seller’s agent have not provided the buyer with 
the hazards booklet, the buyer’s agent may deliver it to the buyer 
themselves, the preparation and delivery of the TDS being the exclusive 
domain of the seller, and in turn the seller’s agent.
While the seller’s agent is required to provide the buyer with the 
mandatory TDS, the seller’s agent has no duty to discuss the effect of 
the hazards with the buyer after the documents have been delivered, 
unless the buyer inquires.
The buyer’s agent reviews the booklet’s explanation of the disclosed 
hazards with the buyer and notes the consequences of the hazards.
On delivery of the TDS by the seller’s agent, it becomes the duty of the 
buyer’s agent to point out the hazards disclosed. They then review the 
booklet’s explanation of the disclosed hazards with the buyer, noting 
the consequences of the hazards and counseling the buyer on the 
alternatives available to mitigate the hazards should they make an 
offer to acquire the property.
Simply handing the buyer and booklet without directing attention to 
the specific contents of the booklet that directly relates to the hazard 
located on the subject property is insufficient.
Further, the buyer’s agent’s discussion about environmental hazards 
with the buyer provides the buyer with information necessary for 
setting the price and terms of any offer the buyer will make to acquire 
the property.
Method of disclosure
The TDS and environmental hazard booklet is delivered by the seller’s 
agent at the time a prospective buyer inquires further about a listed 
property. Alternatively, a counter offer may be needed to make the 242         Video Renewal Course: Real Estate Made Reel™additional disclosures covered by purchase agreement provisions.
Some environmental hazards are itemized in the TDS, such as a direct 
reference to hazardous construction materials and waste, window 
security bars and release mechanisms, and an indirect reference to 
environmental noise. [ See RPI Form 304 §§A and C ]  
All other known environmental hazards are added by separate 
itemization in the TDS. As for environmental hazards emanating from 
off-site locations, they are disclosed through provisions in the purchase 
agreement since they are typically known to buyer’s agents who are 
familiar with the area. [ See RPI Form 150 §12.7]  
Editor’s note — The environmental hazard booklet is not a disclosure of 
known defects on the property. The booklet merely contains general 
information on a few environmental hazards, none of which might 
actually exist on the property. [ See RPI Form 316-1]  
Regardless of the method of delivery, the seller’s agent is to give the 
environmental hazard disclosures to the prospective buyer as soon 
as practicable, meaning as soon as reasonably possible. As with 
the disclosure of natural hazards, the legislature intended for the 
environmental hazard disclosures to be made prior to entry into a 
purchase agreement. [Attorney General Opinion 01-406 (August 24, 
2001)]
Need and motivation for disclosure
For the seller’s agent to properly anticipate the need to have the 
disclosures available to deliver to prospective buyers, the effort to 
promptly gather the information from the seller begins at the moment 
the listing is solicited and entered into.  
The seller and the seller’s agent have numerous good reasons to 
fully comply at the earliest moment with the environmental hazard 
disclosures (as well as all other property-related disclosures). The 
benefits of a full disclosure, up front and before the seller accepts an 
offer or makes a counteroffer, include:  
• the prevention of delays in closing;  Visual inspection and method of disclosure            243• the avoidance of cancellations on discovery under due diligence 
investigation contingencies;  
• the elimination of likely renegotiations over price or offsets for 
corrective costs due to the seller’s agent’s dilatory disclosure or 
the buyer’s discovery during escrow;  
• the shortening of the time needed for the buyer to complete 
their due diligence investigation; and  
• control by the seller of remedial costs and responsibilities by 
terms included in the purchase agreement, not by later offsets 
or demands by the buyer or a court. 
Inquiries documented
The seller’s agent needs to document in writing (for the 
agent’s file only) the agent’s inquiry of the seller about 
environmental hazards which are known or may be known 
to the seller. The agent’s list is to itemize:
• all the environmental hazards which might possibly exist 
on or about a property and the construction materials 
which contain them;
• the age or date of construction to elicit a review of 
probable hazardous construction materials used at the 
time of construction; and 
• information known about the property on disclosures 
the seller received when the seller purchased the 
property or were brought to the seller’s attention on any 
renovation of the property.  
Also, the seller’s agent’s inquiry into hazardous materials 
ought to precede the seller’s preparation of the TDS. Thus, 
the seller is mentally prepared to release information about 
knowledge of defects in the condition of the property. Finally, 244         Video Renewal Course: Real Estate Made Reel™the seller’s agent’s visual inspection needs to be conducted 
before the seller prepares the TDS so the observations may 
be discussed.  
The seller has no obligation to hire an expert to investigate 
and report on whether an environmental hazard is present 
on or about the property. The seller is also not obligated to 
remove, eliminate or mitigate an environmental hazard, 
unless the seller becomes obligated under the terms of the 
purchase agreement with the buyer.  
It is the seller’s and the seller’s agent’s knowledge about 
the property which is disclosed on the TDS. The off-site 
environmental hazards which affect the use of the property 
are generally well known by the buyer’s agent for inclusion 
in the purchase agreement. If not included in the TDS or the 
purchase agreement, a counteroffer by the seller is necessary 
to disclose — as soon as possible — the seller’s and the seller’s 
agent’s knowledge of environmental hazards located both 
on and off the property. Visual inspection and method of disclosure            2451. As part of the seller’s agent’s disclosure of environmental hazards 
and eliminate any further duty to advise the prospective buyer 
about the environmental hazards, the seller’s agent delivers a 
copy of the __________ approved by the California Department of 
Health and Safety (DHS) to the buyer.
a. Transfer Disclosure Statement (TDS)
b. Natural Hazard Disclosure Statement (NHD)
c. environmental hazard booklet
2. On delivery of the Transfer Disclosure Statement (TDS) by the seller’s 
agent, it becomes the primary duty of the __________ to point out 
and discuss the hazards disclosed with the buyer. 
a. buyer’s agent
b. seller’s agent
c. Both a. and b.
3. As a matter of best practices, a seller’s agent is to give the 
environmental hazard disclosures to the prospective buyer:

b. after a purchase agreement offer has been submitted to the 
seller. 
c. as soon as reasonably possible.246         Video Renewal Course: Real Estate Made Reel™
Asbestos in construction materials
Asbestos is any of a diverse variety of fibrous mineral silicates  which 
are commercially mined from natural deposits in the earth. In the 
1940’s manufacturers began mixing asbestos fibers with substances 
commonly used to produce materials for the construction of residential 
and non-residential real estate improvements. [Health & S C §25925]
However, asbestos is a known carcinogen . As an occupant of a 
building continues to inhale asbestos fiber, they increase their risk of 
developing negative health conditions. 
Construction materials which contain friable asbestos are those that 
can be crumbled, pulverized or reduced to powder by hand pressure 
when dry. 
Asbestos in construction materials           247Construction materials which contain non-friable asbestos cannot be 
crushed by hand pressure. Of course, on the removal of stucco or 
plaster, the asbestos may become friable since the material is disturbed 
and broken down for removal, creating particles which may become 
airborne and inhaled.  
The seller of a property constructed with asbestos-containing building 
materials is under no obligation to investigate or have a survey 
conducted to determine the existence of asbestos on the property — 
whether friable or non-friable.  
Further, the seller is not obligated to remove or clean up any adverse 
asbestos condition. However, the condition, if known, will be disclosed. 
As a result, a prospective buyer may well condition the purchase of a 
property containing friable asbestos on its clean up and removal by 
the seller.  
Nuisance: interference with use and enjoyment
Similar to the concept of an environmental hazard, a 
nuisance is anything which:  
• is offensive to the senses;  
• is injurious to health; or  
• obstructs the use of property. [Calif. Civil Code §3479]
Simply, a nuisance is any activity which interferes with an 
owner’s use and enjoyment of their property, including 
conditions which are unhealthy or offensive to the senses. A 
nuisance is broadly interpreted to encompass a wide variety 
of activities.  
An activity becomes a nuisance based on either:  
• a statutory provision identifying conduct that is a 
nuisance per se; or  
• a balancing of the conflicting rights and interests of the 248         Video Renewal Course: Real Estate Made Reel™neighboring property owners.  
A nuisance per se is any activity specifically declared by 
statute to be a nuisance. If an activity is a statutory nuisance, 
it can be ordered stopped by a court without proof of its 
harmful or offensive effect.  
The list of nuisances per se is wide and diverse, including:  
• fences of excessive height unnecessarily exceeding ten 
feet, called spite fences [CC §841.4];
• the illegal sale of controlled substances [CC §3479];
• fire hazards [Calif. Public Resources Code §4171]; and  
• swimming pools which do not comply with statutory 
health and safety standards. [Calif. Health and Safety 
Code §116060] 
Conversely, some activities are declared by statute not to 
be nuisances.  
Activities done or maintained under the express authority of 
a statute, called statutory authority, cannot be nuisances. 
For example, the activities of a commercial agricultural 
processing plant are maintained under statutory authority 
and cannot constitute a nuisance. [CC §§3482, 3482.6]Asbestos in construction materials           2491. __________ is any of a diverse variety of fibrous mineral silicates and 
is a known carcinogen which can increase the risk of developing 
a negative health condition if inhaled. 
a. Formaldehyde
b. Led-based paint
c. Asbestos

be crumbled, pulverized or reduced to powder by hand pressure 
when dry. 
a. water-soluble asbestos
b. friable asbestos

Lead-based paint hazards
Lead-based paint, defined as any surface coating containing at least 
1.0 milligram per square centimeter of lead, or 0.5% lead by weight, 
was banned by the Federal Consumer Product Safety Commission in 
1978. [24 CFR §35.86; 40 CFR §745.103]
A lead-based paint hazard is any condition that causes exposure to 
lead from lead-contaminated dust, soil or paint which has deteriorated 
to the point of causing adverse human health effects. [24 CFR §35.86; 
40 CFR §745.103]
An agent, prior to meeting with the owner to list an older single family 
residence (SFR) property for sale, gathers facts about the property, its 
ownership and its likely market value.  
As the first step, the agent pulls a property profile on the SFR from a 
title company website.  On receipt of the profile, the agent confirms 
their suspicion that the structure was built prior to 1978. The agent is 
now aware the property is the target of separate state and federal 
environmental protection disclosure programs designed to prevent 
the poisoning of children by the presence of lead-based paint.  
The agent meets with the owner to review the requisite listing and 
marketing requirements laid down by the agent’s broker. To prepare Lead-based paint hazards           251for the meeting, the agent fills out the listing agreement and attaches 
all the information disclosure forms needed to properly market the 
property and locate a buyer, called a listing package.  
Disclosed on two forms
Among other informational forms for this pre-1978 SFR property, the 
agent includes two forms which address lead-based paint conditions 
on the property:  
• the Federal Lead-based Paint (LBP) disclosure [See RPI Form 313 ]; 
and  
• the California Transfer Disclosure Statement (TDS). [See RPI Form 
304]
On review of the listing agreement with the owner, the agent explains 
the owner’s legal obligation, owed to prospective buyers and buyer’s 
agents, to provide them with all the information:
• known to the owner or readily available to the owner’s agent on 
observation or inquiry; and
• which might adversely affect the value of the property.  
A full disclosure to the prospective buyer about adverse conditions 
on the property does not entail a review or explanation by the 
seller’s agent about their effect on the buyer or the property once 
the facts are disclosed. Application of the facts disclosed and the 
potential consequences flowing from the facts which may affect the 
prospective buyer’s use, possession or ownership of the property are 
not among the seller’s agent’s duties of affirmative disclosure.  
Seller’s agent insures compliance
However, federal LBP rules do require the seller’s agent to advise 
the owner about the requirements for disclosures to be made to 
prospective buyer before they enter into a purchase agreement. 
It is the seller’s agent who insures compliance by the owner before 
entering into a purchase agreement.

On Sale of Real Estate
NOTE: This form is used by an owner's agent when selling or leasing a residential unit built before 1978 and complying 
with lead-based paint disclosure laws, to notify the buyer or tenant whether lead-based paint or lead-based paint hazards 
are known to the owner to be present on the property and give the buyer and tenant an opportunity to conduct a risk 
assessment or inspection of the property. 
FORM 313      03-11      ©2016 RPI — Realty Publications, Inc., P.O. BOX 5707, RIVERSIDE, CA 92517RPI FORM 313Lead-based paint hazards           253inspected or a report prepared on the presence of lead-based paint 
or any lead-based paint hazards. Also, the owner need not perform 
any corrective work to clean up or even eliminate the lead-based 
paint conditions, unless agreed to with the buyer. [24 Code of Federal 
Regulations §35.88(a); 40 CFR §745.107(a)]
Thus, the owner cooperates in the LBP disclosure and their agent’s 
other marketing efforts by:  
• filling out and signing the federal LBP disclosure form required on 
all pre-1978 residential construction [See RPI Form 313];  
• filling out and signing the TDS containing the lead-based paint, 
environmental and other property conditions [See  RPI Form 304 ];  
• making a physical home inspection report available to 
prospective buyers as an attachment to the TDS form; and  
• providing the seller’s agent with copies of any reports or 
documents containing information about lead-based paint or 
lead-based paint hazards on the property.  
LBP disclosure content  
The LBP disclosure form includes the following:  
• the Lead Warning Statement  as written in federal regulations 
[See RPI Form 313 §1 ];  
• the owner’s statement  disclosing the presence of known  lead-
based paint hazards or the owner’s lack of any knowledge of 
existing lead-based paint [See RPI Form 313 §2];  
• a list of records or reports available to the owner which indicates 
a presence or lack of lead-based paint, which have been 
handed to the seller’s agent [ See RPI Form 313 §2.2];  
• the buyer’s statement acknowledging receipt of the LBP 
disclosure, any other information available to the owner and the 
lead hazard information pamphlet entitled Protect Your Family 
From Lead in Your Home [See RPI Form 313 §3.1; see RPI Form 
316-1 ];  
• the buyer’s statement acknowledging the buyer has received 254         Video Renewal Course: Real Estate Made Reel™a 10-day opportunity to inspect the property or has agreed to 
reduce or waive the inspection period [ See RPI Form  313 §3.2];  
• the seller’s agent’s statement noting the owner has been 
informed of the owner’s disclosure requirements and that the 
agent is aware of their duty to ensure the owner complies with 
the requirements [ See RPI Form 313 §4]; and  
• the signatures of the owner, buyer and seller’s agent. [24 CFR 
§35.92(a)(7); 40 CFR §745.113(a)(7)]
The owner and the seller’s broker each keep a copy of the disclosure 
statement for at least three years from the close of escrow on the 
sales transaction. [24 CFR §35.92(c); 40 CFR §745.113(c)]
Further, the disclosure form is to be written in the language of the 
purchase agreement. For example, if the purchase agreement 
is in Spanish, then the LBP disclosure will also be in Spanish. [24 CFR 
§35.92(a); 40 CFR §745.113(a)]
Opportunity to evaluate risk  
A prospective buyer of a residence built prior to 1978 is put on notice 
of LBP conditions by handing them the disclosure forms before they 
make an offer. The disclosures advise them they have a 10-day period 
after their offer is accepted to evaluate the lead-based paint risks 
involved. When timely disclosed, the buyer may not later, when under 
contract, use the existence of lead-based paint as justification for 
cancellation.
The buyer may agree to a lesser period of time or simply waive all 
their rights to the federally permitted risk evaluation period. However, 
disclosures about the SFR property cannot be waived by the use of an 
“as-is” sale provision or otherwise. [40 CFR §745.110(a); see RPI Form 
313] Lead-based paint hazards           255Foreclosure sale exemption  
Exempt from the Federal LBP disclosures are foreclosure sales 
of residential property. [24 CFR §35.82(a)]
Yet, a foreclosing lender still has a common law duty to 
disclose property defects known to them at the time of 
the foreclosure sale. A foreclosing lender is not protected 
from liability for intentional misrepresentation (negative 
fraud by omission – deceit) when the property is sold “as-is” 
at a foreclosure sale and the foreclosing lender previously 
fails to disclose a known defect to the bidders. [Karoutas v. 
HomeFed Bank (1991) 232 CA3d 767]
However, the LBP foreclosure exemption does not apply 
to the resale of housing  previously acquired by the lender 
at a foreclosure sale, commonly called real estate owned 
(REO) property, or to the resale by a third party bidder who 
acquired the property at a foreclosure sale.
Thus, if a lender or other bidder who acquired property at a 
foreclosure sale is reselling it, the resale needs to comply with 
the lead-based paint disclosure requirements. [61 Federal 
Register 9063]256         Video Renewal Course: Real Estate Made Reel™1. A(n) __________ is any condition that causes exposure to lead from

Natural Hazard Disclosures
A unified Natural Hazard Disclosure for all sales
Natural hazards come with the location of a parcel of real estate, 
not with the man-made aspects of the property. Locations where a 
property might be subject to natural hazards include:  
• special flood hazard areas, a federal designation; 
• potential flooding and inundation areas; 
• very high fire hazard severity zones;  
• wildland fire areas;  
• earthquake fault zones; and  
• seismic hazard zones. [Calif. Civil Code §1103(c)]
The existence of a hazard due to the geographic location of a property 
affects its desirability, and thus its value to prospective buyers. Hazards, 
by their nature, limit a buyer’s ability to develop the property, obtain 
insurance or receive disaster relief.  
Whether a seller lists the property with a broker or markets the property 
themselves, the seller is to disclose to prospective buyers any natural 258         Video Renewal Course: Real Estate Made Reel™hazards known to the seller , including those contained in public 
records.  
To unify and streamline the disclosure by a seller (and in turn the seller’s 
agent) for a uniform presentation to buyers concerning natural hazards 
which affect a property, the California legislature created a statutory 
form entitled the Natural Hazard Disclosure (NHD) Statement. [See RPI 
Form 314] 
Every agent aspires to be fully employed and working for good clients. 
Thus, the clients and the agent will both succeed in closing real estate 
transactions.  The client’s property and its surrounding environment are 
the focal point, the hub, from which all broker employment activities 
emanate.
For every party in any real estate related transaction to do well, it 
is critical that all data and information about a property cannot be 
limited in its quality, quantity and timing of release by the listing or 
leasing agent representing the property owner.  A flood of property 
information is not a hazard in this occupation, but is the beneficial 
A unified Natural Hazard Disclosure for all sales            259antithesis of stark, reluctant releases of information to interested 
buyers.  Reluctance to disclose upfront is a risk that is inconsistent with 
all the current and long-term aspirations of an agent providing real 
estate services as it interferes with closing and invites litigation. Simply 
put, hoarding property information is counterproductive and wrong .
Sellers of one-to-four unit residential property and their agents have 
an affirmative duty to disclose their knowledge about the existence 
of natural hazards to a prospective buyer at the earliest possible 
opportunity – when the buyer starts asking questions which demonstrate 
an interest in buying the property.
Natural hazards come with the location of a parcel of real estate, not 
with the man-made aspects of the property such as those covered in 
a transfer disclosure statement  (TDS). [See RPI Form 304]260         Video Renewal Course: Real Estate Made Reel™1. _________ come with the location of a parcel of real estate, not 
with the man-made aspects of the property.
a. Environmental hazards
b. Toxic hazards 
c. Natural hazards
2. A seller is to disclose to prospective buyers any natural hazards 
known to the seller:
a. unless the seller is not represented by a broker and the natural 
hazards are readily visible on a visual survey of the property 
and surrounding area. 
b. even when the seller is not represented by a broker and the 
hazards are contained in the public records.
c. unless the risk presented by the natural hazards have been 
mitigated by remedial action, such as retrofitting damns and 
sweeping the floors of a forest. 
3. To unify and streamline the disclosure of natural hazards by a seller 
and the seller’s agent, the California legislature created a statutory 
form entitled the:
a. Transfer Disclosure Statement (TDS).
b. Natural Hazard Disclosure (NHD) Statement.
c. Lead-Based Paint (LBP) Disclosure.Flood zones            261
Flood zones
Investigating flood problems was facilitated by the passage of the 
National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 (NFIA).  
The NFIA established a means for property owners to obtain flood 
insurance with the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP).  The 
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is the administrative 
entity created to police the NFIP by investigating and mapping regions 
susceptible to flooding.  
Any flood zone designated with the letter “A” or “V” is a special flood 
hazard area and is to be disclosed as a natural hazard on the NHD 
Statement. [See RPI Form 314 §1]  
Zones “A” and “V” both correspond with areas with a 1% chance of 
flooding in any given year, called 100-year floodplains, e.g., a structure 
located within a special flood hazard area shown on an NFIP map has 
a 26% chance of suffering flood damage during the term of a 30-year 
mortgage.  
However, Zone “V” is subject to additional storm wave hazards.  
Both zones are subject to mandatory flood insurance purchase 
requirements.262         Video Renewal Course: Real Estate Made Reel™Information about flood hazard areas and zones come from:  
• city/county planners and engineers;  
• county flood control offices;  
• local or regional FEMA offices; and  
• the U.S. Corps of Engineers.  
Another flooding disclosure which needs to be made on the NHD 
Statement arises when the property is located in an area of potential 
flooding. [See Form 314 §2]  
An area of potential flooding is a location subject to partial flooding if 
sudden or total dam failure  occurs. The inundation maps showing the 
areas of potential flooding due to dam failure are prepared by the 
California Office of Emergency Services. [Calif. Government Code 
§8589.5(a)]
Once alerted by the seller’s agent to the existence of a flooding 
condition, the buyer’s agent is to inquire further to learn the significance 
of the disclosure to the buyer. 
Marketing a property in a special flood hazard area
Consider a seller of a single family residential property (SFR) 
located in a special flood hazard area who wants to list their 
property for sale.
The agent prepares an Exclusive Right to Sell Listing Agreement  
for review by the seller. [See RPI Form 102]
The agent also prepares a cost workup for the seller 
estimating the cost of third-party investigative reports 
needed to provide prospective buyers with information 
on the property. The reports include those either statutorily 
mandated or demanded by prudent buyers and protective 
buyer’s agents for their information and approval.Flood zones            263

------------------------------------------------------------- PAGE 1 OF 2 — FORM 107  -----------------------------------------------------------nOtE: This form is used by a seller's  agent as an addendum when entering into the employment of an owner who lists 
a property for sale, to disclose the itemized costs the owner can expect to incur during the marketing and sale of the 
property as anticipated by the employment agreement. 
0.00RPI FORM 107264         Video Renewal Course: Real Estate Made Reel™The seller’s agent presents this listing package cost sheet to 
the owner as a “seller’s budget,” also called a marketing 
package cost sheet. It sets out the costs of all third-party 
reports the seller will inevitably incur on a sale of the property. 
[See RPI Form 107]
The cost sheet prepared by the agent estimates the cost 
of investigative reports prepared by other professionals or 
government agencies which will help put a face on the 
property so it can be better evaluated by prospective 
buyers – transparency communicated by disclosures. The 
recommended reports include an NHD statement. The 
agent estimates the cost of the NHD will be no more than 
$100. [See RPI Form 107 §2.1(a)]
After reviewing the estimated costs and marketing 
strategy with the seller’s agent, the seller gives the seller’s 
agent authority to hire a third-party NHD expert of known 
competence to prepare an NHD report on the property. 
[See RPI Form 131]
The seller’s agent, acting on behalf of the seller, orders an 
NHD from an NHD expert. The NHD expert employed by the 
seller at the agent’s suggestion gathers information about 
the geographic area surrounding the seller’s property from 
the public records and prepares the NHD report which they 
sign and deliver to the seller and their agent for a fee of $90.
On receipt of the report prepared by the NHD expert, the 
seller and the agent review it for accuracies or differences 
between their knowledge and the information contained in 
the report. The seller and the agent observe no discrepancies.  
Accordingly, both the seller and agent sign the third-party 
NHD report as mandated. [See RPI Form 314]
The NHD, signed by the expert, seller and agent, is included 
in the agent’s marketing package  used to provide maximum Flood zones            265information on the listed property. The agent is aware the best 
way to market property and avoid further price negotiations 
during escrow is to fully disclose the condition of the property 
when first dealing with the eventual buyer.
A buyer’s expectations about a property are established 
based on their impression of the property developed by 
the time they enter into a purchase agreement, not later 
after the price has been set, a binding purchase agreement 
entered into, escrow opened and then, for the first time, the 
true condition of the property is dilatorily revealed to the 
buyer. [Jue v. Smiser (1994) 23 CA4th 312]
Here, when asked to authorize the ordering out of the NHD 
report, the seller had to choose when to incur the expense 
of the third-party reports; either:
• now, when they list the property for sale, so a purchase 
agreement entered into with a prospective buyer has a 
greater likelihood of closing since deception about the 
property’s existing NHD condition is eliminated by the 
prior delivery of the reports; or
• later, after entering into a purchase agreement with a 
buyer who has already developed expectations about 
the property which may well differ from the reports 
and, unless the seller eliminates the defects or adjusts 
the price, will likely result in the buyer cancelling the 
purchase agreement or closing escrow and demanding 
a return of the overpayment in price or the cost incurred 
for corrective action. [Jue, supra]
Beneficially, the disclosures provide the seller and agent with 
a competitive sales advantage for the seller’s property over 
other apparently qualified properties which are marketed 
without reports to corroborate their condition.
A prospective buyer, having seen the property, indicates 266         Video Renewal Course: Real Estate Made Reel™they have an interest in purchasing the property by asking 
for information.  In response, they are given a copy of the 
marketing package containing the NHD.
After reviewing the NHD (and all the other disclosures) in the 
marketing package, the buyer, now aware the property is 
located within a flood zone, submits an offer to purchase the 
property.  It is eventually accepted and escrow is opened. 
The sale closes and the buyer takes ownership and possession. 
During the spring, the property is flooded, resulting in 
significant damage not covered by insurance.  The buyer 
demands compensation from the seller and the agent for 
money losses due to the flooding, claiming the NHD disclosure 
lacked information about the extent of the flooding or the 
property damage that could occur.
Can the seller or agent be held liable to the buyer for the 
cost to repair the property that was damaged by the flood?
No! Due to the seller’s delivery of the NHD prior to contracting 
to sell the property, the buyer was notified of the material 
fact that the property was located in a special flood area, 
and thus was at greater risk of flooding. Without conducting 
a further due diligence investigation into the disclosed risk, 
the buyer set the price to be paid in his purchase offer to 
acquire the property knowing full well it was located in a 
special flood area. Neither the seller nor the agent had any 
duty to the buyer to advise further about the type or extent 
of losses the risk of flooding presents (unless the agent also 
represented the buyer).
On the other hand, the buyer’s agent had a responsibility to 
assure their buyer understood the extent of these hazard risks 
prior to setting a price and submitting an offer.Flood zones            2671. The __________ is the administrative entity created to police the

a. “A” or “B”
b. “A” or “V”
c. “V” or “X”
3. An area of potential flooding is a location subject to partial flooding 
if:
a. it is rainy for an extended period of time. 
b. sudden or total dam failure occurs.
c. the area has experience any flooding in the prior 100 years. 268         Video Renewal Course: Real Estate Made Reel™
Disclosure of very high fire hazard severity zones
Areas in the state which are subject to significant fire hazards have 
been identified as very high fire hazard severity zones. If a property is 
located in a very high fire hazard severity zone, a disclosure needs to 
be made to the prospective buyer. [See RPI Form 314 §3]  
The city, county or district responsible for providing fire protection have 
designated, by ordinance, very high fire hazard severity zones within 
their jurisdiction. [Calif. Government Code §51179]
The fire hazard disclosure on the NHD form mentions the need to 
maintain the property. Neither the seller nor the seller’s agent need 
to explain the nature of the maintenance required or its burden on 
ownership. Advice to the buyer on the type of maintenance and the 
consequences of owning property subject to the maintenance are 
the duties of the buyer’s agent, if they have an agent.  
Preparing for wildfires
Costly and dangerous wildfires are quickly becoming the norm here 
in California. As wildfires continue to make headlines, homebuyers are 
weighing the risks more heavily and homeowners are taking action. 
Real estate professionals need to be prepared to answer questions Disclosure of very high fire hazard severity zones          269and make recommendations on wildfire safety for both homebuyers 
considering property in these high-risk areas and sellers who may need 
to make fire safety improvements before selling.
Homebuyers will first learn if their potential new home is located in a 
fire hazard zone by receiving a completed Natural Hazard Disclosure 
(NHD). [See RPI Form 314]
But being located in a fire hazard zone isn’t necessarily a deal breaker 
— particularly since homebuyers aren’t likely to shift their search 
outside the zone, when zones can cover whole cities and counties. 
But what might be a deal breaker is a home that is not retrofitted or 
maintained with fire safety in mind.
For example, new homes are always safer from wildfires, since their 
construction adheres to updated building codes. But homeowners of 
older homes can gradually replace parts of the building with fire-safe 
materials as maintenance and improvements are needed. 
Landscaping to reduce a home’s chances of being destroyed in a 
wildfire is also important, including:
• trimming and cutting down unsafe or clustering trees;
• trimming shrubs to a maximum height of 18 inches;
• removing any vegetation within three feet of the home;
• clearing leaves and branches from the yard;
• cleaning gutters and roof debris;
• moving wood piles away from structures; and
• replacing grass or vegetation near the home or other structures 
with gravel.
Planning a home’s landscape to protect the structure from wildfires 
is part of creating defensible space zones. Properties located in very 
high fire hazard severity zones require at least 100 feet of defensible 
space surrounding the home or structure. [Calif. Gov C §51182(a)(1)]
Likewise, agents showing homes to buyers in fire-prone areas can 
keep an eye out for these hazards that increase the chance of wildfire 270         Video Renewal Course: Real Estate Made Reel™damage, such as:
• tall grass and weeds;
• dead or dry leaves, pine needles and tree branches;
• vegetation beneath decks and porches;
• tree limbs within ten feet of the chimney;
• shrubs within a few feet of the home; and
• trees clustered within ten feet of each other on or near the 
property.Disclosure of very high fire hazard severity zones          2711. Areas in the state which are subject to significant fire hazards have

State Fire Responsibility Area
If a property is in an area where the financial responsibility for preventing 
or suppressing fires is primarily on the state, the real estate is located 
within a State Fire Responsibility Area. [Calif. Public Resources Code 
§4125(a)]
Notices identifying the location of the map designating State Fire 
Responsibility Areas are posted at the offices of the county recorder, 
county assessor and the county planning agency. Also, any information 
received by the county after receipt of a map changing the State 
Fire Responsibility Areas in the county needs to be posted. [Pub Res C 
§4125(c)]
If the property is located within a wildland area exposed to substantial 
forest fire risks, the seller or the seller’s agent is to disclose this fact. If 
the property is located in a wildland area, it requires maintenance by 
the owner to prevent fires. [Pub Res C §4136(a); see RPI Form 314 §4]  
In addition, the NHD Statement advises the prospective buyer of a 
home located in a wildland area that the state has no responsibility 
for providing fire protection services to the property, unless the 
Department of Forestry and Fire Protection has entered into a 
cooperative agreement with the local agency. No further disclosure State Fire Responsibility Area           273about whether a cooperating agreement exists need be made by 
the seller or seller’s agent. [See RPI Form 314 §4]  
However, if property disclosures place the property in a wildland area, 
the buyer’s agent has the duty to advise the buyer about the need to 
inquire and investigate into what agency provides fire protection to 
the property.  274         Video Renewal Course: Real Estate Made Reel™1. If a property is in an area where the financial responsibility for

Earthquake fault zones and seismic hazards
To assist seller’s agents in identifying whether the listed property is 
located in an earthquake fault area, maps have been prepared by 
the State Geologist.  
The State Mining and Geology Board and the city or county planning 
department have maps available which identify special studies zones, 
called Alquist-Priolo Maps . [Calif. Public Resources Code §2622]
The maps are used to identify whether the listed property is located 
within one-eighth of a mile on either side of a fault.  
Also, the NHD Statement requires both the seller and the seller’s agent 
to disclose to a prospective buyer or the buyer’s agent whether they 
have knowledge the property is in a fault zone. [See RPI Form 314 §5]  
A Seismic Hazard Zone map identifies areas which are exposed to 
earthquake hazards, such as:  
• strong ground shaking;  
• ground failure, such as liquefaction or landslides [Pub Res C 
§2692(a)];  
• tsunamis [Pub Res C §2692.1];  276         Video Renewal Course: Real Estate Made Reel™• dam failures. [Pub Res C §2692(c)]
If the property for sale is susceptible to any of the earthquake (seismic) 
hazards, the seismic hazard zone  disclosure on the NHD Statement is 
to be marked “Yes.” [See RPI Form 314 §6]  
Seismic hazard maps are not available for all areas of California. Also, 
seismic hazard maps do not show Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault 
Zones. The California Department of Conservation creates the seismic 
hazards maps.   
If the NHD indicates a seismic hazard, the buyer’s agent is to then 
determine which type of hazard, the level of that hazard and explain 
the distinction to the buyer, or be certain someone else does. The 
seller’s agent has no such affirmative obligation to explain the impact 
of the disclosures to the buyer.  
For example, property located in Seismic Zone 4 is more susceptible 
to strong ground shaking than areas in Zone 3. But which zone the 
property is located in is a question the buyer’s agent needs to answer. 
Most of California is in Zone 4, except for the southwest areas of San 
Diego County, eastern Riverside and San Bernardino Counties, and 
most of the Northern California Sierra Counties.  
Homes in Zone 4 are able to be damaged even from earthquakes 
which occur a great distance away.
Insurance against disaster
Normal homeowners insurance does not cover earthquake 
damage. However, earthquake insurance exists to provide 
coverage to homeowners in the event of a tremor. But does 
it pay off?
For most, earthquake insurance is rarely worth it. 
Following the Northridge Earthquake of 1994, when insurance 
companies had to pay out unexpectedly enormous sums Earthquake fault zones and seismic hazards         277to cover their clients, premiums and deductibles rose and 
paybacks decreased. Now, a homeowner has to really get 
“lucky” (read: your home has to be totally destroyed) for the 
amount of premiums paid to pay off. Even then, homeowner 
deductibles are higher than most saving’s accounts. 
Therefore, it may end up being a total loss anyway.
A better investment is to take the money you may spend 
on earthquake insurance premiums and use it to pay for 
retrofitting, if the home is not built to withstand a large quake. 
This includes:
• bolting the home to its foundation (this costs a few 
thousand dollars depending on the state of the home’s 
foundation);
• bracing or reinforcing walls for older homes or those that 
were built improperly (another few thousand dollars); 
and
• homeowner fixes like strapping heavy appliances, 
furniture and televisions to walls (hundreds of dollars at 
most but usually less).
Homeowners are encouraged to hire an experienced 
retrofitting company to inspect the property and provide 
estimates for the work to be completed. Easy fixes like bolting 
furniture and moving heavy objects from top shelves to 
bottom shelves ought to be done as soon as practical, and 
by homeowners in both outdated and brand new homes.
Even with the extra cost to retrofit or insure homes against 
earthquake damage, California’s home values are hardly 
suffering from earthquake fears. Some of the most expensive 
real estate around is located practically on top of California’s 
most active fault lines — in San Francisco and Los Angeles.
That being said, if a homeowner chooses to retrofit their 278         Video Renewal Course: Real Estate Made Reel™home, when they eventually sell they need to include that 
information in their home’s marketing package. Buyers will 
appreciate the fact that they won’t have to worry about 
making these improvements and it may even make them 
aware of other properties that haven’t been retrofitted, 
making the retrofitted home stand out.Earthquake fault zones and seismic hazards         2791. The State Mining and Geology Board and the city or county 
planning department have maps available which identify whether 
a listed property is located in an earthquake fault area called:

c. Meridian-Baseline Maps. 
2. A(n) __________ identifies areas which are exposed to earthquake 
hazards.

is to be marked “Yes.”
a. any
b. greater than one
c. greater than three280         Video Renewal Course: Real Estate Made Reel™
Manifestations of seismic hazards 
When an earthquake occurs, one fault slides against, underneath or on 
top of another. This direction can be vertical, horizontal or somewhere 
in between. 
The San Andreas Fault is a transform fault, meaning it does not subsume 
land to another fault, nor is it subsumed. Rather, the two plates — 
the North American and Pacific Plate — move past each other, in a 
horizontal fashion. When this occurs, observers on the ground may not 
notice the evidence the fault movement leaves behind, but from the 
air it is clearly visible.
In addition to the initial shaking of the ground and potential damage to 
buildings and property, earthquakes cause a lot of indirect damage as 
well. Earthquakes can manifest and cause:
• ground failure , which refers to landslides and liquefaction (when 
loose, wet or sandy soil shifts during the shaking and causes 
building foundations to sink or move);
• tsunamis, large waves caused by earthquakes, volcanic eruptions 
or underwater landslides; and
• dam failure , which results in localized flooding.Manifestations of seismic hazards            281Areas susceptible to inundation due to dam failure caused by an 
earthquake are also noted on the NHD Statement as a potential 
flooding area. [ See RPI Form 314 §5] 
Therefore, even if a property is not located near a fault, it may be 
located in an area where an earthquake may indirectly damage it. 
These areas are identified in geologic maps, available at local city 
planning departments. 
The ground shakes
There have been 54 major earthquakes in California since 1900, 
defined as an earthquake of at least magnitude 6.5, and/or causing 
loss of life or property damage greater than $200,000, according to 
the California Geological Survey. 
The last major earthquake was a magnitude 6.5 and occurred on 
December 22, 2003 in San Simeon, causing substantial damage in 
nearby Paso Robles.
With 54 major earthquakes over the past 115+ years, one major 
earthquake occurs on average every 2.1 years. Therefore, it appears 
California is well overdue for a major earthquake.
Where will the next big earthquake occur?
Statistically, the next “big one” (of around magnitude 8.0) will likely 
occur along the southern end of the San Andreas Fault.
Most of California’s populated areas are located in or near an 
earthquake hazard zone. The exception is California’s Central Valley, 
encompassing cities like Fresno and Sacramento (property lying east 
of I-5 north of Delano and south of Redding). Here, you are as safe as 
you can be (in California) from earthquakes.
The West Coast of the United States is particularly susceptible to 
earthquakes, as it lies alongside the western edge of the North 
American Plate, where it butts up against the Pacific Plate. Students 
of Geology may recall the Ring of Fire, which encircles much of the 
Pacific Ocean. California makes up a significant portion of the ring, 
282         Video Renewal Course: Real Estate Made Reel™though its main symptom is earthquakes, rather than the volcanoes 
experienced in much of the Pacific.
Can scientists predict earthquakes?
The ability to predict earthquakes does exist, but the warning 
time is short and California has yet to fully implement an alert 
system.
It works like this: There are two types of waves that occur 
when an earthquake strikes. The shear waves or “S” waves 
cause the shaking that is so destructive to property. However, 
several seconds before the “S” wave hits, a mostly silent 
primary wave, or “P” wave, arrives. Dogs and other animals 
sensitive to sound can detect P waves, but human ears 
usually cannot. 
Earthquake predicting technologies alert the user when a “P” 
wave is detected. This gives the user a few seconds to head 
for cover, turn off a gas stove, exit an elevator or complete 
any last-second preparations. The warning time depends on 
how deep the quake is and how far the epicenter is from the 
user.Manifestations of seismic hazards            2831. __________ is a seismic hazard which refers to landslides and

The NHD form for uniformity
Whether a seller lists the property with a broker or markets the property 
themselves, the seller is to disclose to prospective buyers any natural 
hazards known to them, including those contained in public records.  
The seller and seller’s agent prepare the statutory Natural Hazard 
Disclosure (NHD) Statement to disclose their awareness of natural 
hazards. Alternatively, the NHD form can be prepared by a natural 
hazard expert, then verified and used by the seller and their agent. 
[See RPI Form 314]  
The form is to include information known to the seller and seller’s agent 
(and the NHD expert) and readily available to them as shown on maps 
in the public records of the local planning department. [Calif. Civil 
Code §1103.2; see RPI Form 314]  
Actual use of the NHD Statement by sellers and their agents is 
mandated on the sale of all types of properties, with some sellers (but 
not agents) being excluded. While some sellers need not use the form 
when making the NHD disclosures, agents are never excluded. Thus, 
the form, filled out and signed by the seller (unless excluded) and the 
seller’s agent (never excluded), is included in marketing packages

Natural hazards are to be disclosed
Delivery of the hazard information, whether disclosed by the use of 
one form or another, is not optional. Disclosure of a natural hazard is 
mandated on all types of property. [Calif. Civil Code §1103.1(b)]
All sellers, and any seller’s or buyer’s agents involved, have a general 
duty owed to prospective buyers to disclose conditions on or about 
a property which are known to them and might adversely affect the 
buyer’s willingness to buy or influence the price and terms of payment 
the buyer is willing to offer.  
Natural hazards, or the lack thereof, irrefutably affect a property’s 
desirability, and thus value to a prospective buyer. 
If a hazard is known to any agent (as well as the seller) or noted in 
public records, it is to be disclosed to the prospective buyer before 
they enter into a purchase agreement on the property. If not disclosed, 
the buyer may cancel the transaction, called termination. 
Alternatively, if the transaction has closed escrow, the buyer may 
rescind the sale and be refunded their investment, called restoration. 
[Karoutas v. HomeFed Bank  (1991) 232 CA3d 767]
The need for an NHD when a prospective buyer is located, an Natural hazards are to be disclosed           289anticipation held by every seller’s agent on taking a listing, requires 
the NHD to be prepared, signed and part of the property marketing 
package.  
The NHD Statement handed to a prospective buyer is unrelated to 
the environmental hazards and physical deficiencies in the soil or 
property improvements. These hazards are disclosed by use of the 
Transfer Disclosure Statement (TDS) and provisions in the purchase 
agreement. [ See RPI Form 304 §C(1)]  
The NHD Statement discloses risks to life and property which exist in 
nature due to the property’s location, risks known and readily available 
from the public records (planning department).

b. retribution.
c. termination.
2. If a natural hazard has not been disclosed and the transaction has 
closed escrow, the buyer may rescind the sale and be refunded 
their investment. This is called:
a. reversion. 
b. treble damages. 
c. restoration.
3. Which of the following is the Natural Hazard Disclosure (NHD)

on?
a. Physical deficiencies in the soil or property improvements.
b. Potential flooding and inundation areas.
c. Lead-based paint identified within the property. Investigating the existence of a hazard          291
Investigating the existence of a hazard
Natural hazard information is obtained from the public records. If not 
retrieved by someone, the seller and seller’s agent cannot make their 
required disclosures to prospective buyers.  
To obtain the natural hazard information, the seller and the seller’s agent 
are required to exercise ordinary care in gathering the information. 
They may gather the information themselves or the seller may employ 
an NHD expert to gather the information. When an expert is employed, 
the expert prepares the NHD form for the seller and the seller’s agent 
to review, add any comments, sign and have ready for delivery to 
prospective buyers. [Calif. Civil Code §1103.4(a)]
Thus, the seller and seller’s agent may obtain natural hazard information :  
• directly from the public records themselves; or  
• by employing a natural hazard expert, such as a geologist.
For the seller and the seller’s agent to rely on an NHD report prepared 
by others, the seller’s agent need only:  
• request an NHD report from a reliable expert in natural hazards, 
such as an engineer or a geologist who has studied the public 
records;  292         Video Renewal Course: Real Estate Made Reel™• review the NHD form prepared by the expert and enter any 
actual knowledge the seller or seller’s agent may possess; and  
• sign the NHD Statement provided by the NHD expert and deliver 
it with the NHD report to prospective buyers or buyer’s agents. 
[CC §1103.2(f)(2)]
When prepared by an NHD expert, the NHD report needs to also note 
whether the listed property is located within two miles of an existing 
or proposed airport, an environmental hazard zone called an airport 
influence area  or airport referral area . 
The buyer’s occupancy of property within the influence of an airport 
facility may be affected by noise and restrictions, now and later, 
imposed on the buyer’s use as set by the airport’s land-use commission. 
[CC §1103.4(c)]
Also, the expert’s report is to note whether the property is located 
within the jurisdiction of the San Francisco Bay Conservation and 
Development Commission.  
Broker uses experts to limit liability
The Natural Hazard Disclosure scheme encourages brokers and 
their agents to use natural hazard experts to gather and report the 
information available to all from the local planning department rather 
than do it themselves. The use of an expert to gather information from 
the public record and prepare the report relieves the seller’s agent of 
any liability for errors  not known to the agent to exist.
While an agent is not mandated to use of an expert, the practice is 
prudent as a risk mitigation step undertaken to manage liability on 
sales listings. The other NHD risk for seller’s agents is eliminated by the 
timely delivery of the NHD to prospective buyers before going under 
contract.
Neither the seller nor any agent, whether the seller’s or the buyer’s 
agent, is liable for the erroneous preparation of an NHD Statement 
they have delivered to the buyer, if:  
• the NHD report and form is prepared by an expert in natural Investigating the existence of a hazard          293hazards, consistent with professional licensing and expertise; and  
• the seller and seller’s agent used ordinary care in selecting 
the expert and in their review of the expert’s report for any 
errors, inaccuracies and omissions of which they have actual 
knowledge. [CC §§1103.4(a), 1103.4(b)]
Caution:  The seller’s agent’s dilatory delivery of an expert’s NHD to 
the buyer or the buyer’s agent, after the offer has been accepted, will 
not protect the broker from liability  for the buyer’s lost property value 
due to the nondisclosure before acceptance. If the agent knew or 
ought to have known of a natural hazard noted in the readily available 
planning department’s parcel list, the agent is exposed to liability. 294         Video Renewal Course: Real Estate Made Reel™1. Natural hazard information is best obtained from the:
a. planning department. 
b. public records.
c. title company. 
2. The use of a natural hazard expert to gather information from the 
public record and prepare the report:
a. relieves the seller’s agent of any liability for errors not known to 
the agent to exist.
b. relieves the seller of any liability for failure to note a material 
fact in the Transfer Disclosure Statement (TDS). 
c. imposes an additional burden on the seller’s agent to locate a 
qualified expert, creating a greater degree of liability. 
3. While an agent is not mandated to use a natural hazard expert, 
the practice is:
a. generally more expensive than it is worth since the seller needs 
to pay for the natural hazard expert. 
b. prudent as a risk mitigation step undertaken to manage liability 
on sales listings. 
c. required under the California Business and Professions code. Documenting compliance with NHD law            295
Documenting compliance with NHD law
Compliance by the seller and seller’s agent to deliver the NHD 
Statement to the buyer is required to be documented by a provision 
in the purchase agreement. [See RPI Form 150 §12.5; Calif. Civil Code 
§1103.3(b)]  
However, when the seller’s agent fails to disclose a natural hazard and 
then provides in the purchase agreement for the compliance to be 
an untimely “in escrow” disclosure, the seller is statutorily penalized .
The buyer on an in-escrow disclosure after entering into a purchase 
agreement and as an alternative to a money claim, has a statutory 
remedy allowing them to terminate the purchase agreement and 
avoid the transactions by exercising:

Delivery of the NHD to the buyer
It is the buyer’s agent who has the duty to hand the buyer the NHD 
Statement the buyer’s agent receives from the seller or the seller’s 
agent, called delivery. [Calif. Civil Code §1103.12(a)]
The buyer’s agent, on receiving the NHD form from the seller’s agent, 
owes the buyer a special agency duty to care for and protect the 
buyer’s best interest. This is accomplished by reviewing the NHD 
Statement themselves for any disclosure which might affect the 
property’s value or its desirability for the buyer. The buyer’s agent then 
delivers the NHD to the buyer and makes any recommendations or 
explanations they may have regarding the adverse consequences of 
its content. [CC §§1103.2, 1103.12]
If the buyer does not have a broker, the seller’s agent is responsible for 
delivering the NHD Statement to the prospective buyer.  
The task of explaining the consequence of living with a natural hazard 
is the duty of a buyer’s agent. If the buyer is not represented by an 
agent, the buyer undertakes the duty to protect themselves and 
investigate the consequences of the NHD information handed to 
them.  Delivery if the NHD to the buyer            299Delivery may be in person or by mail. Also, delivery is considered to 
have been made if the NHD is received by the spouse of the buyer. 
[CC §1103.10]
Sellers occasionally act as “For Sale By Owners” (FSBOs)  and directly 
negotiate a sale of their property with buyers and buyer’s agents. Here, 
the seller is responsible for preparing or obtaining an NHD statement 
and delivering the NHD Statement to the prospective buyer – prior to 
entering into the purchase agreement.  
No warranty, just awareness
A seller’s NHD Statement is not a warranty or guarantee  by the seller or 
seller’s agent of the natural hazards affecting the property. The NHD 
Statement is a report of the seller’s and seller’s agent’s (or the NHD 
expert’s) knowledge (actual and constructive) of any natural hazards 
affecting the property.  
As a matter of proper practice, the purchase agreement offer 
includes a copy of the seller’s NHD Statement as an addendum (along 
with all other disclosures), noting the transaction was entered into in 
compliance with NHD (and TDS) law. 
Other disclosure statements distinguished
The NHD Statement handed to a prospective buyer is 
unrelated to the environmental hazards and physical 
deficiencies in the soil or property improvements. These 
hazards are disclosed by use of the Transfer Disclosure 
Statement (TDS) and provisions in the purchase agreement. 
[See RPI Form 304 §C(1)]
